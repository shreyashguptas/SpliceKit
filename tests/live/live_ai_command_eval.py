"""
Comprehensive test suite for Apple Intelligence ai_command.

Tests 120+ natural language queries against the command.ai endpoint,
validates the returned action plans, and reports pass/fail with details.

Usage:
    python3 tests/live/live_ai_command_eval.py              # run all tests
    python3 tests/live/live_ai_command_eval.py --group effects  # run one group
    python3 tests/live/live_ai_command_eval.py --execute    # actually execute actions (will modify timeline!)

Requires: FCP running with SpliceKit injected, bridge on 127.0.0.1:9876
