# SpliceKit - Programmatic Final Cut Pro Control

SpliceKit is an ObjC dylib injected into FCP's process. It exposes all 78,000+ ObjC classes
via a JSON-RPC server on TCP 127.0.0.1:9876. Everything is fully programmatic -- no AppleScript,
no UI automation, no menu clicks.

## NEVER Use Keyboard Simulation or AppleScript

All FCP actions MUST go through direct ObjC calls. Never use any of these:
- `SpliceKit_simulateKeyPress()` or synthetic NSEvent key events
- `CGEvent` keyboard/mouse posting
- `osascript` / `NSAppleScript` / AppleScript `tell application`
- Accessibility APIs (`AXUIElement`) for clicking or typing
- Frame-stepping loops (`nextFrame` x N) when `seekToTime` exists

**Instead, always use one of these patterns (in priority order):**
1. **Direct method call** on the timeline/sequence/clip object via `objc_msgSend`
2. **Responder chain** via `[NSApp sendAction:NSSelectorFromString(@"selector:") to:nil from:nil]`
3. **Batch bridge endpoint** (e.g. `timeline.addMarkers`) for operations on multiple items
4. **Menu execute** via `menu.execute` for actions only accessible through menus

If an action doesn't have a direct ObjC selector yet, find one using `explore_class` /
`search_methods` on the relevant class (FFAnchoredTimelineModule, FFAnchoredSequence, etc.)
rather than simulating the keyboard shortcut.

## Quick Start

```
1. bridge_status()                    -- verify connection
2. open_project("My Project")         -- open a project by name
3. get_timeline_clips()               -- see timeline contents: spine clips + connected clips + markers
4. get_clip_info("obj_12")            -- what is IN the clip: source file, transcript words, effects, title text, a frame image
5. browser_list_clips()               -- source clips in the browser, with handles
6. add_clip_to_timeline("obj_5", edit="connect", start_seconds=12, end_seconds=18, at_seconds=45)
                                      -- a range of that source clip pasted at the playhead (the effect of Insert / Connect / Append)
7. timeline_action("blade")           -- edit
8. verify_action("after blade")       -- confirm state changed
9. capture_timeline()                 -- visually verify the timeline
10. capture_viewer()                  -- visually verify the viewer/canvas
```

## CRITICAL: Must Know Before Editing

### Opening a Project
Use `open_project()` to load a project by name:
```python
open_project("My Project")                   # find by name
open_project("Edit v2", event="4-5-26")      # filter by event too
```

If you need lower-level control, you can still navigate manually:
```python
# Navigate: library -> sequences -> find one with content -> load it
libs = call_method_with_args("FFLibraryDocument", "copyActiveLibraries", "[]", true, true)
libs_handle = json.loads(libs)["handle"]
lib = call_method_with_args(libs_handle, "objectAtIndex:", '[{"type":"int","value":0}]', false, true)
lib_handle = json.loads(lib)["handle"]
seqs = call_method_with_args(lib_handle, "_deepLoadedSequences", "[]", false, true)
seqs_handle = json.loads(seqs)["handle"]
allSeqs = call_method_with_args(seqs_handle, "allObjects", "[]", false, true)
# For each sequence result, extract its "handle" before calling hasContainedItems
# Example: seq_handle = json.loads(seq)["handle"]
# Check each: call_method_with_args(seq_handle, "hasContainedItems", "[]", false)
# Load: get NSApp -> delegate -> activeEditorContainer -> loadEditorForSequence:
```

### Select Before Acting
Color correction, retiming, titles, and effects require a selected clip:
```
seek_to_time(12.5)                        # position the playhead
timeline_action("selectClipAtPlayhead")   # select primary storyline clip
timeline_action("addColorBoard")          # now apply
```

To select a connected clip (title, B-roll, etc.) use `select_clip_in_lane()`:
```
select_clip_in_lane(lane=1)               # select connected clip above primary
select_clip_in_lane(lane=-1)              # select connected clip below
select_clip_in_lane(lane=0)               # same as selectClipAtPlayhead
```

To act on a specific clip without moving the playhead, select it by handle:
```
get_timeline_clips()                      # every clip (spine + connected) comes with a handle
select_clips(handles=["obj_12"])          # make that clip the selection (add/remove modes too)
timeline_action("addColorBoard")          # now apply
```
Markers are not selectable this way; an empty list deselects everything.

### Playhead Positioning
- 1 frame = ~0.042s at 24fps, ~0.033s at 30fps
- Use `seek_to_time(seconds)` for precise positioning. This is the rule at the top of this
  file: never step frame by frame to reach a time `seek_to_time` can jump to.
- `nextFrame` / `prevFrame` are for moving one or two frames off a position you are
  already at — nudging to the next edit, checking the frame after a cut.
- `batch_timeline_actions` is fastest for multi-step sequences

### Undo After Mistakes
```
timeline_action("undo")   # undoes last edit, returns action name
timeline_action("redo")   # redoes it
```
Undo routes through FCP's FFUndoManager (not the responder chain).

Group a multi-step edit into ONE undo step (Edit > Undo <name>; FCP's internal term is an undoable action):
```
begin_edit("Rough cut")   # open the group
blade_at_times([...]); trim_clip(...); ...
end_edit()                # close it -- always, also after an error; one undo now reverts it all
```

### Timeline Data Model (Spine)
FCP stores items in: `sequence -> primaryObject (FFAnchoredCollection) -> containedItems`
- `FFAnchoredMediaComponent` = video/audio clips
- `FFAnchoredTransition` = transitions (Cross Dissolve, etc.)
- `get_timeline_clips()` handles this automatically

```

## Common Workflows

### Blade at a specific time
```
seek_to_time(3.0)         # jump to 3 seconds
timeline_action("blade")  # cut there
```

### Multiple cuts (batch — preferred)
```
blade_at_times([3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0, 15.0])   # cut at all times in one call
```

### Trim a clip to an exact time
```
get_timeline_clips()                                              # find the clip's handle
trim_clip("obj_12", edge="end", to_seconds=8.0, dry_run=True)     # plan: before/projected ranges
trim_clip("obj_12", edge="end", to_seconds=8.0)                   # ripple trim the end edit point to 8.0s
```
This is FCP's default trim, a ripple edit (dragging a clip's start or end point with the Select tool):
subsequent clips move so no gap is left, and connected clips move with the clips they are attached to.
A start-point trim on the primary storyline keeps the clip in place and changes its duration.
`delta_seconds=-0.5` works too (negative = edit point earlier). Each trim is one undo step (Edit >
Undo shows the name SpliceKit passes, "Trim"; inside a `begin_edit` group, that group's step). Undo with `timeline_action("undo")`.

### Look inside a clip
```
get_timeline_clips()                      # find the clip's handle
get_clip_info("obj_12")                   # Info inspector fields + (SpliceKit) placement, effects, title text, markers, transcript words, a frame image
capture_clip_frame("obj_12")              # the clip as rendered in the Viewer (effects included); moves the playhead and restores it
```
`get_clip_info` never moves the playhead: its frame is decoded from the source media file (no effects), and the
tool returns it as MCP image content. Titles, generators and gap clips have no source media file and say so; a
compound clip (FCP: reference clip, its `isReferenceClip` flag, verified on 12.3; a multicam or synchronized clip
answers the same flag) has no single one, so `get_clip_info` reports no source file and no frame for it
(`capture_clip_frame` shows it as the Viewer shows it) and `get_timeline_clips` marks it [reference clip].
`kind`, handles and `timings` are SpliceKit bookkeeping, not FCP terms.

### Hear the audio of the clips
```
get_audio_levels("obj_12")                        # one clip (+ its primary-storyline neighbours, summary only, for the cuts)
get_audio_levels(start_seconds=40, end_seconds=70) # every clip with audio in a timeline range
get_audio_levels()                                 # the whole timeline (first 100 clips with audio)
get_audio_levels("obj_12", detail="full")          # the raw per-slice arrays as JSON
```
SpliceKit's own measurement of each clip's source audio, as numbers: per clip the peak and RMS
level per slice (50 ms by default, longer for clips over 30 s so no clip reports more than 600
slices) in dBFS (0 = full scale; -100 is the floor for a slice with no sample above 1e-5), placed
in timeline seconds, with the seconds below the silence threshold (RMS under -50 dBFS by default)
at the clip's start and end, the slices at full scale (peak >= -0.1 dBFS: possible clipping), the
loudest moment, and the RMS of the first and last 100 ms (or one slice, whichever is longer). The
answer carries a sparkline per clip and a waveform strip as inline MCP image content (one row per
lane, light = peak, dark = RMS, red = full scale, white = straight cuts). For neighbouring
primary-storyline clips that were both analysed it reports the outgoing clip's end against the
incoming clip's start and the jump in dB, or that a transition sits on the cut (FCP crossfades
attached audio there, which is not checked). Read-only.

Not Final Cut Pro's audio meters (the mix during playback) and not its timeline waveforms (which
follow the clip's volume and effects): the levels are those of the source media file as decoded by
SpliceKit's `audio-levels` helper (`tools/audio-levels.swift`, built by `make install`), so FCP's
volume, fades, effects, retiming and the mix of all concurrent clips are NOT applied, the same way
`get_clip_info`'s frame is the raw footage. Channels are pooled, never mixed: a slice's peak is the
loudest sample in any channel and its RMS is over all channels' samples (for a file with one audio
track, the figures ffmpeg's volumedetect gives; a clip line saying mixdownMono fell back to the
decoder's mono mixdown, which reads 3 dB high on dual-mono files). The mapping assumes normal speed
(100%); `retimed` is FCP's own flag (`isRetimed`; a frame-rate conform was seen to set it by itself
on 12.3, and the note compares two readings of the media file's video, its average frame rate and the
rate its shortest frame duration corresponds to, with the project's rate, saying when it cannot tell
which one FCP's Rate Conform goes by) when the clip object answers
one, and "unknown" otherwise. The clip's start point in its source media is read from FCP's
`clippedRange` (else `trimStartTime` / `trimmedOffset`) against the media's start timecode
(`unclippedRange.start`), the same reading the transcript panel uses; when none answers, the levels start
at the file's start and the answer says so. Transitions,
gap clips, titles and generators have no audio of their own; a compound or multicam clip has no
single source file; both are listed as skipped. A harsh audio cut: read the outgoing clip's end and the jump
(a single handle brings its neighbours along), then `trim_clip`, a fade
(`direct_timeline_action("applyAudioFadesDirect")` on the selected clip) or `changeAudioVolume`, and
read again. `slice`, `edge window`, `jump` and the sparkline are SpliceKit bookkeeping, not FCP
terms. Raw RPC: `timeline.getAudioLevels`.

### Put a clip into a library, and take one back out
```
import_media(path="/path/to/clip.mov", event="My Event")   # add footage to an event
remove_browser_clip(name="clip", event="My Event")         # the exact inverse; file on disk untouched
remove_browser_clip(name="Old Cut", include_projects=True) # a project is a whole timeline: opt in
remove_browser_clip(name="clip", dry_run=True)             # see what would go first
cleanup_temp_projects(dry_run=True)                        # SpliceKit's own leftovers, nothing of yours
cleanup_temp_projects()                                    # move them to the library trash
```
`remove_browser_clip` refuses a name that matches more than one item and tells you which
ones matched — pass `event=` or a handle to say which. `cleanup_temp_projects` only ever
matches names SpliceKit generates itself ("SK Structure 1271", "_SKPaste_8180",
"SpliceKit Caption Import 7362"), whole-name, number required; a project of yours called
"SK Structure notes" is left alone, and an empty event is never removed.

### Add a source clip, or a range of it, to the timeline
```
browser_list_clips()                                                       # name, event, handle, isProject
add_clip_to_timeline("obj_5", edit="connect", start_seconds=12, end_seconds=18, at_seconds=45, dry_run=True)
add_clip_to_timeline("obj_5", edit="connect", start_seconds=12, end_seconds=18, at_seconds=45)
add_clip_to_timeline("obj_5", edit="insert", at_seconds=0)                 # whole clip, the effect of Insert (W) at 0s
add_clip_to_timeline("obj_5", edit="append")                               # whole clip, the effect of Append (E)
```
Check `isProject` before using a row: a project sits in the browser next to the source
clips but it is a whole timeline, and these tools refuse it. Open it with
`open_project(name)` instead. An exact project name always beats a longer one that merely
contains it, so `open_project("QA Timeline")` opens that and not "QA Timeline 1".
SpliceKit writes the range to FCP's pasteboard and uses FCP's Edit > Paste (`insert`: into the primary
storyline at the playhead, later clips move right) or Edit > Paste as Connected Clip (`connect`: a
connected clip at the playhead; FCP picks the lane); `append` moves the playhead to the end of the
primary storyline, pastes there and leaves the playhead there. For insert and connect this is FCP's
three-point edit: source start + end, playhead as the timeline point. `start_seconds`/`end_seconds` are
the equivalent of a browser range selection (Set Range Start I / End O), counted from the clip's first
frame; `at_seconds` moves the playhead first; `backtimed=True` (connect only, the effect of Connect to
Primary Storyline - Backtimed, Shift-Q) puts the end of the range at the playhead. No overwrite: FCP has
no paste that overwrites (FCP's own E/W/Q/D on the browser's current selection are
`timeline_edit_action("appendEdit" | "insertEdit" | "connectToPrimaryStoryline")` and
`timeline_destructive_action("overwriteEdit")`). The answer re-reads the timeline and reports the placed
clip as `get_timeline_clips()` does, whether its duration matches the range and its position the target
(within two frames, at least 50 ms), and anything else the edit created. The pasteboard is replaced.
The edit is a single paste, so `history_action("undo")` removes it in one step.

### Cuts at regular intervals across entire timeline
```
# Compute times: every 3s across a 30s timeline
blade_at_times([3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0, 15.0, 18.0, 21.0, 24.0, 27.0])
```

### Multiple cuts (batch_timeline_actions alternative)
```
batch_timeline_actions('[
  {"type":"playback","action":"goToStart"},
  {"type":"playback","action":"nextFrame","repeat":48},
  {"type":"timeline","action":"blade"},
  {"type":"playback","action":"nextFrame","repeat":48},
  {"type":"timeline","action":"blade"},
  {"type":"playback","action":"nextFrame","repeat":48},
  {"type":"timeline","action":"blade"}
]')
```

### Add color correction
```
playback_action("goToStart")
timeline_action("selectClipAtPlayhead")
timeline_action("addColorBoard")
```

### Change speed
```
timeline_action("selectClipAtPlayhead")
timeline_action("retimeSlow50")    # 50% speed
# Undo: timeline_action("undo")
```

### Add markers at intervals
```
playback_action("goToStart")
batch_timeline_actions('[
  {"type":"playback","action":"nextFrame","repeat":120},
  {"type":"timeline","action":"addMarker"},
  {"type":"playback","action":"nextFrame","repeat":120},
  {"type":"timeline","action":"addChapterMarker"}
]')
```

### Create project via FCPXML (no restart)
```
xml = generate_fcpxml(
    project_name="My Project",
    frame_rate="24",
    items='[
      {"type":"gap","duration":10},
      {"type":"title","text":"Introduction","duration":5},
      {"type":"transition","duration":1},
      {"type":"gap","duration":15},
      {"type":"marker","time":5,"name":"Chapter 1","kind":"chapter"}
    ]'
)
import_fcpxml(xml, internal=True)
```

### Inspect clip effects
```
timeline_action("selectClipAtPlayhead")
get_clip_effects()  # shows effect names, IDs, handles
```

### Analyze timeline health
```
analyze_timeline()  # pacing, flash frames, clip stats
```

### Batch export clips individually
```
batch_export(folder="/path/to/output")                 # every clip on the timeline
batch_export(folder="/path/to/output", scope="selected")  # only the selected clips
```

`folder` is required. Without it the bridge would have to open a folder picker and wait
for someone to answer it, which parks FCP's main thread — a save/open panel cannot be
confirmed over the bridge at all, only cancelled. The folder is created if missing.

Each clip is exported individually with all effects/color grading baked in.
For each clip, SpliceKit:
1. Computes the clip's exact position in the timeline
2. Sets the in/out range (mark in/out) to the clip boundaries
3. Queues the export; the files appear in the folder as FCP renders them

Set your default share destination in FCP first (File > Share > Add Destination).

### Set in/out range programmatically
```
set_timeline_range(start_seconds=5.0, end_seconds=10.0)  # mark in at 5s, out at 10s
timeline_action("setRangeStart")   # mark in at current playhead
timeline_action("setRangeEnd")     # mark out at current playhead
timeline_action("clearRange")      # remove range selection
```

### Text-based editing via transcript
```
open_transcript()                              # transcribe all clips on timeline
open_transcript(file_url="/path/to/video.mp4") # transcribe a specific file
open_transcript(force_retranscribe=True)       # discard cache and re-transcribe
get_transcript()                               # get words with timestamps + speakers + silences + gap histogram
delete_transcript_words(start_index=5, count=3) # delete words 5-7 (removes video segment)
move_transcript_words(start_index=10, count=2, dest_index=3) # reorder clips
search_transcript("hello")                     # search for text in transcript
search_transcript("pauses")                    # find all silences/pauses
delete_transcript_silences()                   # batch-remove all silences from timeline
delete_transcript_silences(min_duration=1.0)   # remove only silences > 1 second
set_transcript_speaker(start_index=0, count=50, speaker="Host")  # label speakers
set_silence_threshold(threshold=0.5)           # recompute silences immediately (no re-transcription)
close_transcript()                             # close the panel
```

The transcript panel opens inside FCP as a floating window with an **engine selector dropdown**:
- **Parakeet v3** (default) — NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B multilingual (25 languages), on-device via FluidAudio
- **Parakeet v2** — English-optimized variant, same speed
- **Apple Speech** — SFSpeechRecognizer (slower; SpliceKit requests on-device recognition)
- **FCP Native** — Built-in AASpeechAnalyzer

All clips are transcribed in a single batch process (model loaded once, reused across clips).
Speaker diarization is available with Parakeet engines (checkbox in UI).

Panel features:
- Shows transcribed text grouped by **speaker segments** with timecode ranges (HH:MM:SS:FF)
- **Silence markers** `[...]` shown inline between words where pauses are detected
- Click a word to jump the playhead to that time
- Click a silence marker to jump to that pause
- Select words and press Delete to remove those video segments (ripple delete)
- Select silence markers and press Delete to remove pauses
- Drag words to reorder clips on the timeline
- Current word is highlighted as playback progresses
- **Search bar** with text search and filter by Pauses or Low Confidence
- **Batch operations**: Delete all search results or delete all silences
- Result count with prev/next navigation (Cmd+F to focus search)

Deleting words performs: blade at start -> blade at end -> select segment -> delete
Moving words performs: blade + cut at source -> move playhead -> paste at destination

## Transitions
```
list_transitions()                             # list all 376+ available transitions
list_transitions(filter="dissolve")            # filter by name or category
apply_transition(name="Flow")                  # apply by display name
apply_transition(name="Cross Dissolve")        # apply specific transition
apply_transition(effectID="HEFlowTransition")  # apply by effect ID
```

Transitions are applied at the current edit point. Navigate to an edit point first:
```
timeline_action("nextEdit")           # go to next edit point
apply_transition(name="Flow")         # apply Flow transition there
```

### Freeze Extend (not enough media handles)
When clips don't have enough extra media beyond their edges for a transition, FCP normally
shows a dialog offering to ripple trim. SpliceKit adds a third option: **"Use Freeze Frames"**.

- **UI button**: Whenever the "not enough extra media" dialog appears (including manual use),
  a "Use Freeze Frames" button is added. It extends clip edges with freeze frames and
  re-applies the transition without shortening the project.
- **API parameter**: Use `freeze_extend=True` to automatically extend with freeze frames:
```
apply_transition(name="Cross Dissolve", freeze_extend=True)  # auto freeze-extend if needed
```

This creates freeze frames at the outgoing clip's last frame and the incoming clip's first
frame, providing the media handles needed for the transition overlap.

## Command Palette
```
show_command_palette()                         # open the palette (or Cmd+Shift+P)
search_commands("blade")                       # find commands by name/keyword
execute_command("blade", type="timeline")      # run a command directly
ai_command("slow this clip to half speed")     # natural language via Apple Intelligence
hide_command_palette()                         # close it
```

The command palette opens as a floating window inside FCP:
- Fuzzy search across all available actions (editing, playback, color, speed, markers, etc.)
- Arrow keys to navigate, Return to execute, Escape to close
- Type natural language sentences and press Tab to ask Apple Intelligence
- Falls back to keyword matching when Apple Intelligence is unavailable
- Also accessible via toolbar button or Enhancements menu

## Playhead & Selection
```
get_playhead_position()              # current time, duration, frame rate, playing state
get_selected_clips()                 # selected clips in timeline (spine + connected, marked "connected": true)
list_markers()                       # all markers: time, kind, name, completion, handle
list_markers(kind="chapter")         # filter by kind: standard, todo, chapter, keyword, analysis
add_markers_at_times("5.0, 12.0")    # batch standard markers at timeline seconds (JSON form too)
seek_to_time(3.5)                    # jump to 3.5 seconds instantly (faster than stepping)
```
`add_markers_at_times` places every marker in one undo step (Edit > Undo reverts the whole batch).
`get_timeline_clips()` also lists connected clips (titles, B-roll, music on lanes != 0, with
the spine index they are anchored to) and markers; raw RPC: `timeline.getDetailedState` returns
`connectedItems` + `markers`, `timeline.getMarkers` returns markers only.

## Screenshots & Visual Verification

Use `capture_viewer()` and `capture_timeline()` to take screenshots of FCP without
bringing it to the foreground. These capture the window's content directly — no `screencapture`
needed. The resulting PNGs can be read by Claude to visually verify edits. Flat detection
trims uniform Viewer chrome / letterbox bars and tests the inner content; a one-colour
content region is reported with `flat: true` and a WARNING line (it can also be a genuinely
black frame or gap). Captures render in-process from FCP's views; a locked screen does not blank them.

**When to use:**
- After applying effects, color corrections, titles, or captions → `capture_viewer()`
- After blade cuts, rearranging clips, adding markers, or any timeline edit → `capture_timeline()`
- When debugging layout issues (clip positions, gaps, transitions) → `capture_timeline()`
- When verifying text rendering (font, size, position) → `capture_viewer()`

```
capture_viewer()                     # screenshot viewer to /tmp/splicekit_viewer.png
capture_viewer(path="/tmp/check.png") # screenshot to custom path
capture_timeline()                   # screenshot timeline to /tmp/splicekit_timeline.png
capture_timeline(path="/tmp/tl.png") # screenshot to custom path
```
`capture_viewer`, `capture_timeline` and `capture_inspector` also return the image inline as MCP image
content (`return_image=False` to skip), so any MCP client can look at it without reading the PNG.
For one clip, `get_clip_info()` returns a frame of its source media file and `capture_clip_frame()` the
clip as rendered in the Viewer, both inline.

## Viewer Zoom
```
get_viewer_zoom()                    # current zoom level (0.0=Fit, 1.0=100%, 2.0=200%)
set_viewer_zoom(0.0)                 # fit to window
set_viewer_zoom(1.0)                 # 100%
set_viewer_zoom(2.0)                 # 200% — any float value accepted
```

## Export FCPXML (No Dialog)
```
export_xml()                                       # export to /tmp/splicekit_export.fcpxml
export_xml(path="/tmp/my_project.fcpxml")           # export to custom path
```
Programmatic export — no save dialog. Returns the FCPXML file path.

## OpenTimelineIO Import & Export
```
export_otio()                                      # export to /tmp/splicekit_export.otio
export_otio(path="/tmp/my_project.otio")           # export as .otio (DaVinci Resolve native)
export_otio(path="/tmp/my_project.fcpxml")         # export as .fcpxml (native FCP exporter)
export_otio(path="/tmp/my_project.edl")            # export as EDL (Premiere/Resolve/Avid)
export_otio(path="/tmp/my_project.edl", rate=29.97) # EDL with explicit frame rate
export_otio(path="/tmp/my_project.aaf")            # export as AAF (Avid Media Composer)
import_otio(path="/tmp/from_resolve.otio")         # import .otio from DaVinci Resolve
import_otio(path="/tmp/project.fcpxml")            # import .fcpxml into FCP
import_otio(path="/tmp/premiere.edl", rate=29.97)  # import EDL from Premiere (set fps)
import_otio(path="/tmp/avid.aaf")                  # import AAF from Avid
import_otio(otio_json='{"OTIO_SCHEMA":...}')       # import raw OTIO JSON string
```

Universal timeline import/export via OpenTimelineIO. Handles all OTIO formats
AND FCPXML/EDL/AAF, replacing `import_fcpxml` / `export_xml` as the primary tools.
Enables timeline exchange with DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer.

Supported formats:
- `.otio` — OpenTimelineIO native JSON (DaVinci Resolve, universal)
- `.fcpxml` — Final Cut Pro XML (uses FCP's native importer/exporter for full fidelity)
- `.edl` — CMX 3600 EDL (Premiere, Resolve, Avid — set `rate` for drop-frame)
- `.aaf` — Avid AAF (requires Avid-specific metadata on clips)
- `.otioz` / `.otiod` — OTIO bundles (media files must exist on disk)

Optional extra (not in `mcp/requirements.txt`; `make install` does not install it):
`pip install opentimelineio otio-fcpxml-adapter otio-cmx3600-adapter` (the legacy
`otio-fcpx-xml-adapter` also works). This is what the tools' own error message says.
SpliceKit reads Final Cut Pro's FCPXML itself and only falls back to an adapter for
shapes it does not recognise, so the adapter is optional for the FCPXML path.
If the packages are missing, `export_otio` / `import_otio` tell you to install them.

## Deploy & Restart FCP
```
deploy_and_restart()                 # build, deploy, kill FCP, relaunch, wait for bridge
deploy_and_restart(skip_build=True)  # just restart FCP (skip make deploy)
```

## Dialog Automation
**Note:** The "video properties of this clip are not recognized" dialog is now
auto-dismissed at the start of every bridge request. No manual handling needed.
```
detect_dialog()                      # scan for open dialogs, see buttons/fields/checkboxes
click_dialog_button(button="OK")     # click by title (case-insensitive, partial match)
click_dialog_button(index=0)         # click by index
fill_dialog_field(value="My Project") # fill text field
toggle_dialog_checkbox("Use custom settings", checked=True)
select_dialog_popup(select="4K")     # choose from dropdown
dismiss_dialog(action="default")     # click default button to close
dismiss_dialog(action="cancel")      # cancel/escape
```

## Scene Detection

Three tools share the same analysis: one timeline clip (or a file on disk), only the portion
of the media that clip actually uses. Reported cut times are **source media file seconds**, not
timeline seconds; `mark_scene_changes` and `blade_scene_changes` map them onto the clip.

**Target clip** (same resolution for detect / mark / blade): `handle` if given; else the sole
selected clip; else the primary-storyline clip under the playhead; else an error listing spine
candidates. There is no automatic "longest clip" fallback. A compound, multicam, or synchronized
clip is refused — pass `handle` to a specific inner clip or use `file_url` on the underlying file.

**`file_url`**: analyse a path directly (no timeline clip). Times are file seconds only;
`mark_scene_changes` and `blade_scene_changes` refuse this mode (nothing to map cuts onto).

Output includes the scanned window, e.g. `Clip used source media range: 0.000-12.012s`.

```
detect_scene_changes()                                    # read-only: list cuts + scores
detect_scene_changes(threshold=0.2)                       # more sensitive
detect_scene_changes(threshold=0.5, sample_interval=0.25) # less sensitive, faster
detect_scene_changes(handle="obj_12")                     # analyse this clip
detect_scene_changes(file_url="/path/to/footage.mov")     # file-only analysis

mark_scene_changes()                                      # markers at cuts (one undo step)
mark_scene_changes(handle="obj_12", threshold=0.2)
blade_scene_changes()                                     # blade at cuts (one undo step)
blade_scene_changes(handle="obj_12", sample_interval=0.25)
```

`detect_scene_changes(action=...)` with `markers` or `blade` is rejected; use
`mark_scene_changes()` or `blade_scene_changes()` instead.

## Beat Detection
```
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/song.mp3")         # detect beats, bars, sections, BPM
detect_beats(file_path="song.mp3", sensitivity=0.8) # more sensitive
detect_beats(file_path="song.mp3", min_bpm=120, max_bpm=180) # for fast music
detect_beats(file_path="song.mp3", limit=32)        # show first 32 timestamps per kind; rest summarized
```
Built and installed with the other Swift helpers (`make tools` / `make install`).

## Song Cut (Beat-Synced Video Assembly)

Build a contiguous primary-storyline cut synced to a song's Apple beat map.
Uses beat detection from one sequence, video clips from another, and assembles
the result via FCPXML import — no per-clip latency, handles any segment count.

### Quick Start
```
# 1. Have three sequences in your library:
#    - A song sequence (with beat detection already run on the audio)
#    - A video clip sequence (source footage to cut from)
#    - An empty target sequence (or let it create a new project)

# 2. Open the target sequence
open_project("My Target")

# 3. Build the song cut
build_song_cut(
    pace="natural",                          # pacing preset
    source_project_name="My Song",           # sequence with beat-detected audio
    clip_source_project_name="My Footage",   # sequence with video clips
    build_mode="fcpxml",                     # "fcpxml" (recommended) or "native"
    project_name="My Song Cut",              # name for the generated project
)
```

### Pacing Presets
| Preset | Grid | Behavior |
|--------|------|----------|
| `natural` | half_beat | Mostly whole-beat cuts, sometimes two beats, rarely paired half-beats |
| `medium` | half_beat | 1-2 beat cuts |
| `fast` | half_beat | Half- to full-beat cuts, half-beats always paired |
| `aggressive` | quarter_beat | Quarter- to full-beat cuts |

**Half-beat pairing rule**: On a half_beat grid, when a half-beat step is chosen,
the next segment is forced to also be a half-beat. This ensures half-beat cuts
always come in pairs, resolving on whole-beat boundaries.

### Custom Pacing (bypass presets)
```
assemble_random_clips_to_song_beats(
    grid="half_beat",                        # beat, half_beat, quarter_beat, bar, section
    segment_min_step=1,                      # min grid intervals per cut
    segment_max_step=4,                      # max grid intervals per cut
    step_weights='{"1": 1, "2": 8, "4": 3}', # bias toward whole beats
    source_project_name="My Song",
    clip_source_project_name="My Footage",
    build_mode="fcpxml",
    project_name="Custom Cut",
)
```

### Build Modes
- **`fcpxml`** (recommended): Generates complete FCPXML and imports once. Handles
  any segment count instantly. Creates a new project in the library.
- **`native`**: Direct in-app append edits via browser selection. Works for smaller
  builds (~50 segments) but times out on large ones. Supports `target_current_timeline=True`
  to append into the active empty timeline.

### Source Requirements
- **Song**: Must have Apple beat detection run on it (`hasTimingMetadata` = true).
  Run beat detection in FCP first (select clip → Modify → Detect Beats), or use
  `detect_beats()` on the audio file.
- **Video pool**: Any sequence with video clips. Clips are reused with random in-points
  when the pool is smaller than the song. Set `allow_clip_reuse=False` to prevent reuse.
- **Song audio**: Automatically attached underneath the video on lane -1.
  Set `include_audio=False` to omit.

### Dry Run
```
build_song_cut(pace="natural", source_project_name="Song", 
               clip_source_project_name="Footage", dry_run=True)
# Returns: segment count, gap count, tempo, plan details — no changes made
```

## SRT Import
```
import_srt_as_markers(srt_content="1\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000\nSubtitle text")
```
`import_srt_as_markers` is one undo step (all subtitles from the SRT land in a single Edit > Undo).

## SpliceKit Options
```
get_bridge_options()                                # see all configurable options
set_bridge_option("effectDragAsAdjustmentClip", True)   # drag effects to create adjustment clips
set_bridge_option("viewerPinchZoom", True)              # trackpad pinch-to-zoom on viewer
set_bridge_option("videoOnlyKeepsAudioDisabled", True)  # keep audio disabled in video-only mode
set_bridge_option("suppressAutoImport", True)           # stop auto-opening Import window on card/camera mount
set_bridge_option_value("defaultSpatialConformType", "fill")  # default new clips to Fill (crop to fill frame)
set_bridge_option_value("defaultSpatialConformType", "none")  # default new clips to None (native resolution)
set_bridge_option_value("defaultSpatialConformType", "fit")   # restore FCP default (Fit)
```

## Object Handles
```
# Get a handle to an object
r = call_method_with_args("FFLibraryDocument", "copyActiveLibraries", "[]", true, true)
# r = {"handle": "obj_1", "class": "__NSArrayM", ...}

# Use handle in subsequent calls
call_method_with_args("obj_1", "objectAtIndex:", '[{"type":"int","value":0}]', false, true)

# Read properties via KVC
get_object_property("obj_2", "displayName")

# Always clean up
release_all_handles()
```

Argument types: string, int, double, float, bool, nil, sender, handle, cmtime, selector

## Error Recovery
- "No active timeline module" -> No project open. Load one (see above).
- "No sequence in timeline" -> Same. Need loadEditorForSequence:.
- "Cannot connect" -> FCP not running. Launch it.
- "Handle not found" -> Released or GC'd. Get a fresh reference.
- "No responder handled X" -> Action not available (wrong state or no selection).
- Broken pipe -> Stale connection. Next call auto-reconnects.

## Key Classes

Each method entry includes: selector name, ObjC type encoding, IMP hex address, owning
image (via dladdr), and linker symbol name. Ivar entries include byte offsets for struct
reconstruction.

## Debug & Diagnostics (FCP Internal Developer Tools)

SpliceKit exposes FCP's internal developer logging, debug overlays, and performance
monitoring tools that are normally hidden. These are built into FCP's own frameworks
(ProAppSupport, TimelineKit, Helium, ProCore) and controlled via NSUserDefaults and
CFPreferences keys.

### Quick Start
```
debug_get_config()                              # see all current debug settings
debug_enable_preset("timeline_visual")          # turn on visual debug overlays
debug_enable_preset("all_off")                  # reset everything to normal
```

### Get Current State
```
debug_get_config()
```
Returns the current value of every debug flag organized into four groups:
- **timeline_debug**: 35 TLKUserDefaults keys (visual overlays, logging, rendering)
- **cfpreferences_debug**: 6 CFPreferences keys (video decoder, frame drops, GPU)
- **proapp_log**: ProAppSupport structured log system (level, categories, UI, threads)
- **fcp_flags**: FCP behavioral overrides (gap coalescing, snapping, skimming)

### Set Individual Flags
```
debug_set_config("TLKShowHiddenGapItems", "true")       # show hidden gaps in timeline
debug_set_config("TLKPerformanceMonitorEnabled", "true") # enable perf monitor
debug_set_config("LogLevel", "trace")                    # most verbose logging
debug_set_config("VideoDecoderLogLevelInNLE", "3")       # video decoder verbosity
debug_set_config("GPU_LOGGING", "true")                  # GPU/FxPlug logging
debug_set_config("TLKShowHiddenGapItems", "false")       # turn it back off
```

TLK flags take effect immediately (TLKUserDefaults is reloaded live).
CFPreferences flags may require FCP restart for some subsystems.

### Presets (Enable Groups of Flags)
```
debug_enable_preset("timeline_visual")     # visual debug overlays
debug_enable_preset("timeline_logging")    # timeline subsystem logging
debug_enable_preset("performance")         # perf monitor + decoder/frame drop logging
debug_enable_preset("render_debug")        # disable rendering layers + GPU logging
debug_enable_preset("verbose_logging")     # trace-level logging + log UI + thread info
debug_enable_preset("all_off")             # reset all debug flags to defaults
```

**Preset details:**

| Preset | What it enables |
|--------|----------------|
| `timeline_visual` | Lane indices, misaligned edges, render bar, hidden gaps, invalid layouts, color-highlight changed objects |
| `timeline_logging` | Log layer changes, parts, reload requests, recycling, visible rect changes, segmentation stats |
| `performance` | TLK performance monitor, VideoDecoderLogLevelInNLE=2, FrameDropLogLevel=2 |
| `render_debug` | Disable filmstrip/background/waveform rendering, enable GPU logging (isolate render issues) |
| `verbose_logging` | LogLevel=trace, LogUI=true, LogThread=true, EnableScheduledReadAudioLogging=true |
| `all_off` | Remove all debug flags, reset CFPreferences, clear log settings |

### Framerate Monitor
```
debug_start_framerate_monitor(2.0)   # log fps every 2 seconds
debug_stop_framerate_monitor()       # stop monitoring
```
Uses FCP's built-in HMDFramerate (ProCore). Reports to system log:
- Overall fps
- Average getFrame() call time in ms
- Min/max frame times

View output: `log stream --process "Final Cut Pro"` or Console.app

### Reset
```
debug_reset_config("all")       # reset everything
debug_reset_config("tlk")       # reset timeline flags only
debug_reset_config("cfprefs")   # reset CFPreferences only
debug_reset_config("log")       # reset ProAppSupport log settings only
```

### How Debug Tools Help

**Diagnosing timeline layout issues**: Enable `timeline_visual` preset to see lane
indices, hidden gaps, misaligned edges, and invalid layout rects. This reveals
structural problems invisible in the normal UI.

**Performance troubleshooting**: Enable `performance` preset + `debug_start_framerate_monitor()`
to measure actual rendering fps and identify bottlenecks. Video decoder and frame drop
logging pinpoint decode pipeline issues.

**Render pipeline isolation**: The `render_debug` preset disables filmstrips, backgrounds,
and waveforms independently, letting you isolate which rendering subsystem is causing
problems. GPU logging captures the FxPlug/shader pipeline.

**Verbose logging for development**: The `verbose_logging` preset sets ProAppSupport to
trace level with the log UI enabled, giving maximum visibility into FCP's internal
operations. Useful when developing new SpliceKit features or investigating FCP behavior.

**Understanding timeline internals**: `TLKShowHiddenGapItems` and `TLKShowZeroHeightSpineItems`
reveal items FCP hides from the user, helping understand the true timeline data model.

## Runtime Metadata Export (for IDA Pro & Reverse Engineering)

Extract rich ObjC runtime metadata from the live FCP process — data that static binary
analysis cannot provide. Used to enrich IDA Pro decompilation and build the 303K-function
decompiled codebase.

### Bulk Class Metadata Export
```
dump_runtime_metadata(binary="Flexo")              # full metadata for all Flexo classes
dump_runtime_metadata(binary="Flexo", classes_only=True)  # just class names (fast)
dump_runtime_metadata()                             # all images (large!)
```

Returns per class:
- **Instance & class methods** with selector, type encoding, IMP address, **dladdr info**
  (which binary owns the IMP — reveals category methods from other frameworks)
- **Ivars** with name, type encoding, and **byte offset** (for struct reconstruction)
- **Ivar layout bitmaps** — which ivars are strong vs weak references
- **Protocol conformances** with **full method declarations** (required/optional,
  instance/class, type encodings) and protocol inheritance chains
- **Parsed property attributes** — type, getter/setter selectors, backing ivar,
  readonly/copy/strong/weak/nonatomic/dynamic (structured, not raw attribute strings)
- **Superclass chain** and **instance size**

### Loaded Image Enumeration
```
list_loaded_images()                     # all 1255 loaded Mach-O images
list_loaded_images(filter="Flexo")       # filter by name
```
Returns path, base address, ASLR slide, and ObjC class count per image.
The ASLR slide is needed to map runtime IMP addresses → IDA static addresses.

### Mach-O Section Data
```
get_image_sections(binary="Flexo")       # selector refs, class refs
```
Returns:
- **Selector references** — every ObjC selector the binary calls (44K+ for Flexo)
- **Class references** — which classes the binary references
- **Superclass references** — parent class dependencies

For shared-cache system frameworks, uses ObjC runtime APIs instead of raw section reads.

### Symbol Discovery with Swift Demangling
```
get_image_symbols(binary="Flexo", filter="Timeline")   # filtered
get_image_symbols(binary="TimelineKit")                 # all symbols
```
Discovers exported symbols via dladdr on all methods. Swift symbols are automatically
demangled using `swift_demangle()` from libswiftCore.

### Notification Name Discovery
```
get_notification_names(binary="Flexo")   # notification-related classes & symbols
```
Finds classes with "Notification" in their name and enumerates their methods.
Also resolves well-known notification name constants (e.g., `FFEffectsChangedNotification`).

### IDA Pro Integration Scripts
The `tools/` directory contains scripts for applying runtime metadata to IDA Pro:

```bash
# Step 1: Export runtime metadata from live FCP
python3 tools/fcp_runtime_export.py --binary Flexo -o ida_export

# Step 2: Run IDA headless with metadata enrichment + decompile
RUNTIME_JSON=ida_export/Flexo.json DECOMPILE_OUTPUT_DIR=output \
  idat -A -S"tools/ida_apply_and_decompile.py" /path/to/Flexo
```

**What the IDA script does:**
1. Declares struct types from ivars with correct offsets and typed members
2. Registers types in IDA's local type library (persists across sessions)
3. Renames functions to ObjC names (`sub_XXXX` → `-[FFPlayer play]`)
4. Sets function prototypes with typed parameters
5. Adds class hierarchy and protocol conformance comments
6. Creates enums for known constant sets
7. Triggers type propagation across the entire binary

**Tools:**
- `tools/fcp_runtime_export.py` — Collection script (connects to SpliceKit, dumps JSON per binary)
- `tools/ida_apply_and_decompile.py` — IDAPython headless script (applies metadata + decompiles)
- `tools/ida_objc_types.py` — ObjC type encoding parser (converts `@"NSArray"` → `NSArray *`)
- `tools/ida_import_runtime.py` — Interactive IDAPython script (for use inside IDA GUI)
- `tools/batch_enhanced_decompile.sh` — Batch process all 53 FCP binaries

## In-Process Debugging (Debugger Parity)

SpliceKit includes a full debugging toolkit that provides Xcode/lldb-level capabilities
from within FCP's process, accessible via MCP. No debugger attachment required.

### Breakpoints (pause + inspect + continue)
```
debug_breakpoint(action="add", class_name="FFAnchoredTimelineModule", selector="blade:")
# ... press B in FCP — execution pauses, breakpoint.hit event fires ...
debug_breakpoint(action="inspect")                                      # see paused state
debug_breakpoint(action="inspectSelf", key_path="sequence.displayName") # inspect properties
debug_breakpoint(action="continue")                                     # resume execution
debug_breakpoint(action="step")                                         # resume + break on next call
```
Supports conditional breakpoints (`condition="keyPath"`), hit counts (`hit_count=5`),
and one-shot breakpoints (`one_shot=True`). FCP freezes while paused (same as Xcode).
The JSON-RPC server stays alive on a separate thread so you can inspect state.

### Method Tracing (non-blocking alternative)
```
debug_trace_method(action="add", class_name="FFAnchoredTimelineModule",
                   selector="blade:", log_stack=True)
# ... perform action in FCP ...
debug_trace_method(action="getLog", limit=10)  # see calls + call stacks
debug_trace_method(action="removeAll")         # clean up
```
Traces are broadcast to MCP clients in real-time as JSON-RPC notifications.
Use tracing when you want to observe without pausing, breakpoints when you need
to inspect state at a specific moment.

### Property Watching (replaces watchpoints)
```
debug_watch(action="add", class_name="NSApplication", key_path="mainWindow")
# Events broadcast when property changes with old/new values
debug_watch(action="removeAll")
```

### Crash Handler (replaces debugger crash catching)
```
debug_crash_handler(action="install")   # catch exceptions + signals
debug_crash_handler(action="getLog")    # see crash stack traces
```
Catches NSExceptions and signals (SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, etc.) with full stack traces.

### Thread Inspection
```
debug_threads()                    # thread count, operation queues
debug_threads(detailed=True)       # per-thread CPU usage, run state, stacks
```
Uses Mach kernel APIs. Shows all ~45 threads with CPU usage percentages.

### Expression Evaluation (replaces lldb `po`)
```
debug_eval(expression="NSApp.delegate._targetLibrary.displayName")
debug_eval(chain='["delegate", "_targetLibrary"]', store_result=True)  # chain is a JSON string
```
Walks ObjC property chains. Stores results as handles for further inspection.

### Hot Plugin Loading (replaces dlopen from lldb)
```
debug_load_plugin(action="load", path="/tmp/patch.dylib")    # inject code
debug_load_plugin(action="unload", path="/tmp/patch.dylib")  # remove it
```
Compile a `.dylib` with fixes/features, load into running FCP without restart.

### Notification Observation
```
debug_observe_notification(action="add", name="FFEffectsChangedNotification")
debug_observe_notification(action="add", name="*")  # all notifications (high volume)
debug_observe_notification(action="removeAll")
```
Subscribe to FCP's internal NSNotification events. Broadcast to MCP clients.

## Direct Timeline Actions (`direct_timeline_action`)

Calls Flexo's parameterized `action*` methods directly on FFAnchoredTimelineModule
with real arguments. More powerful than the simple responder-chain `timeline.action`.

### Retiming (direct control)
```
direct_timeline_action(action="retimeSetRate", rate=0.5, ripple=True)
direct_timeline_action(action="retimeSpeedRamp", to_zero=True)
direct_timeline_action(action="retimeInstantReplay", rate=0.5, add_title=True)
direct_timeline_action(action="retimeJumpCut", frames_to_jump=5)
direct_timeline_action(action="retimeRewind", speed=2.0)
direct_timeline_action(action="insertFreezeFrame")
```

### Markers (programmatic manipulation)
```
direct_timeline_action(action="changeMarkerType", type_="chapter")
direct_timeline_action(action="changeMarkerName", name="Intro", marker="obj_5")
direct_timeline_action(action="markMarkerCompleted", completed=True)
```

### Audio (precise control)
```
direct_timeline_action(action="changeAudioVolume", amount=-6.0, relative=True)  # amount is dB here
direct_timeline_action(action="applyAudioFadesDirect", fade_in=True, duration=0.5)
direct_timeline_action(action="setBackgroundMusic", enabled=True)
```

### Other direct actions
```
direct_timeline_action(action="addKeywords", keywords='["Interview", "B-Roll"]')  # JSON string
direct_timeline_action(action="removeEffectByID", effect_id="HEFlowTransition")
direct_timeline_action(action="renameAngle", name="Camera 2")
direct_timeline_action(action="newProject", name="My Project")
direct_timeline_action(action="alignToMusicMarkers")
direct_timeline_action(action="duplicateCaptions", language="es", format_="SRT")
```

### Raw selector fallback
```
direct_timeline_action(selector="actionValidateAndRepair:validateMode:error:")
```

See `docs/DEBUG_TOOLS_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive documentation of all debug
endpoints, parameters, workflows, and recipes.

## Full API Reference
See `docs/FCP_API_REFERENCE.md` for comprehensive documentation of all key classes,
methods, properties, notifications, and patterns. This reference is sufficient to use
SpliceKit without access to the decompiled FCP source code.

## Social Media Captions
```
open_captions()                                    # open panel + transcribe timeline
open_captions(style="bold_pop")                    # open with preset style
get_caption_state()                                # check transcription progress + segments
get_caption_styles()                               # list all 13 style presets
set_caption_style(preset_id="neon_glow")           # apply a preset
set_caption_style(preset_id="bold_pop", font_size=80, position="center")  # customize
set_caption_grouping(mode="words", max_words=4)    # control word grouping
generate_captions(style="bold_pop")                # generate + paste to user's timeline
verify_captions()                                  # inspect titles to verify text/font
get_title_text()                                   # read text/font from selected title
export_captions_srt(path="/tmp/captions.srt")      # export SRT subtitles
export_captions_txt(path="/tmp/captions.txt")      # export plain text
```

Generates word-by-word highlighted, animated caption titles as FCPXML. The pipeline:
1. Imports FCPXML into a temp project (resolves Motion template)
2. Copies titles from temp project to clipboard (native format)
3. Pastes as connected storyline onto the user's actual timeline
4. Applies position offset via ObjC transform (not FCPXML adjust-transform)
5. Self-verifies: inspects first title's CHChannelText for text/font/size
6. Cleans up the temp project

No drag-and-drop, no dialogs, captions land directly on the user's timeline.

**Style presets** (13 built-in): `bold_pop`, `neon_glow`, `clean_minimal`, `handwritten`,
`gradient_fire`, `outline_bold`, `shadow_deep`, `karaoke`, `typewriter`, `bounce_fun`,
`subtitle_pro`, `social_bold`, `social_reels`

**Positions**: bottom (default lower third), center, top, custom

**Animations**: none, fade, pop, slide_up, typewriter, bounce

**Word grouping modes**: social (2-3 words, 0.5s silence break — best for TikTok/Reels),
words (max N per group), sentence (by punctuation), time (max seconds), chars (max characters)

Each caption is a `<title>` element with `<text-style>` attributes. Word-by-word
highlight uses multiple `<text-style>` refs per title — the active word gets the
highlight color, others get the base text color.

**Title text inspection**: `get_title_text()` reads text content, font family, font name,
and point size from the selected Motion title's CHChannelText channel. `verify_captions()`
walks connected titles on the timeline and checks text/fontSize against the expected style.

## Lua Scripting

SpliceKit embeds a Lua 5.4 VM directly in FCP's process. Scripts use the `sk`
module to control FCP with zero latency:

```lua
sk.blade()                          -- blade at playhead
sk.seek(5.0)                        -- jump to 5 seconds
sk.select_clip()                    -- select clip at playhead
sk.color_board()                    -- add color correction
local clips = sk.clips()           -- get timeline clips as Lua table
local pos = sk.position()          -- get playhead position
sk.rpc("effects.apply", {name = "Gaussian Blur"})  -- any RPC method
sk.eval("NSApp.delegate.className") -- ObjC runtime bridge
```

**Entry points:**
- REPL panel: Ctrl+Option+L (Enhancements > Lua REPL)
- Live coding: save .lua files to `~/Library/Application Support/SpliceKit/lua/auto/`
- JSON-RPC: `lua.execute`, `lua.executeFile`, `lua.reset`, `lua.getState`, `lua.watch`
- MCP tools: `lua_execute`, `lua_execute_file`, `lua_reset`, `lua_watch`, `lua_state`

See `docs/LUA_SDK_REFERENCE.md` for the full SDK with 25 sections, 140+ RPC methods,
and complete cookbook examples.

## MCP Server Internals (for contributors)

`mcp/server.py` is one MCP server over stdio on the official MCP Python SDK 2.x
(`mcp>=2.2,<3` in `mcp/requirements.txt`; `MCPServer` from `mcp.server.mcpserver`,
protocol revision 2026-07-28, legacy `initialize` handshake still accepted). Every tool
is registered with `@splicekit_tool("name")`, which attaches the tool's annotations
(READ_ONLY_TOOLS / DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS / IDEMPOTENT_LOCAL_WRITE_TOOLS) and turns unexpected
exceptions into a `ToolError` whose text reaches the client. Tools return `-> str`
(published as structured output `{"result": ...}`); the image tools carry no return
annotation so they can return text + image content. The 2.x SDK runs sync tools in
worker threads, so `BridgeConnection.call` holds a lock for each round trip. The server's
`instructions` are a task-organized map of which tool does what; keep it in step when adding tools.

```
make mcp-check         # every tool/resource/prompt over MCP against a fake bridge (no FCP)
make mcp-check-live    # read from the running patched FCP through the MCP server
python3 -m unittest tests/test_mcp_tool_annotations.py tests/test_mcp_server_v2.py   # offline, no mcp package needed
```
