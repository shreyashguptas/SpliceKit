# Beat Detection Internals Guide

This guide documents how Final Cut Pro's built-in beat detection actually works,
how SpliceKit exposes it, and how that differs from SpliceKit's standalone
`detect_beats()` analysis tool.

It is based on five sources:

1. Live runtime inspection of FCP through SpliceKit's ObjC bridge
2. Decompiled Flexo symbols related to beat detection
3. Headless `arm64` IDA decompilation of `AudioAnalysis.framework`
4. Headless `arm64` IDA decompilation of `MusicUnderstandingEmbedded.framework`
5. SpliceKit's own source and MCP behavior

## Two Different Systems

There are two distinct beat-detection paths in this project:

| System | Entry Point | Scope | Works On | Output |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|
| FCP built-in beat grid | `enableBeatDetection` / `detectBeatsOnSelection:` | Timeline objects | Only beat-grid-capable timeline clips | Clip timing metadata + optional visible beat grid |
| SpliceKit external detector | `detect_beats(file_path=...)` | Arbitrary media file | Any file with an audio track, including MP4 with video | Beat/bar/section timestamps and BPM |

These systems are related conceptually, but they are not interchangeable.

The built-in FCP command is much stricter about what kinds of selected timeline
objects it accepts. The standalone SpliceKit detector is much more permissive.

---

## Built-In FCP Beat Detection

SpliceKit maps the timeline action `enableBeatDetection` to FCP's built-in
selector `detectBeatsOnSelection:`.

The decompiled method `-[FFAnchoredTimelineModule detectBeatsOnSelection:]`
shows a simple three-way state machine:

1. If any selected primordial clip `canDetectBeats`, run async beat analysis
2. Else if any selected primordial clip `canShowBeats`, enable the beat grid
3. Else if any selected primordial clip `canHideBeats`, disable the beat grid

In other words, the same command serves as:

- "analyze this clip for beats"
- "show the beat grid for an already-analyzed clip"
- "hide the beat grid for an already-analyzed clip"

The command is backed by `FFEnableBeatGridCommand`.

---

## Command Validation Rules

FCP validates the menu item in
`-[FFAnchoredTimelineModule validateUserInterfaceItem:]`.

For `detectBeatsOnSelection:` the menu is enabled when the selected items satisfy
any of these:

- `FFEnableBeatGridCommand canDetectBeatsOnObjects:`
- `FFEnableBeatGridCommand canShowBeatsOnObjects:`
- `FFEnableBeatGridCommand canHideBeatsOnObjects:`

If none of those are true, the menu item is disabled.

`FFEnableBeatGridCommand` does not inspect only the top-level selected objects.
It recursively walks "primordial" clips via
`_iterateOverPrimordialClipsWithinObjects:usingBlock:`.

That walker descends into selected collections that are both:

- `isSpine == true`
- `isAnchored == true`

and then evaluates their `containedItems`.

This is why selecting a container or collection can still resolve down to a
child clip for beat-detection eligibility.

---

## What Makes a Clip Beat-Detectable

The core predicate is `-[FFAnchoredObject canDetectBeats]`.

Decompiled logic:

```text
canDetectBeats =
    _supportsBeatGrid
    && !isFlexMusicObject
    && sequence.supportsBeatDetection
    && hasAudio
    && !hasTimingMetadata
```

That means a clip is eligible for first-time beat analysis only if:

- it is a beat-grid-capable object
- it is not a FlexMusic object
- its sequence supports beat detection
- it has audio
- it does not already have timing metadata

### Sequence-Level Gate

`-[FFAnchoredSequence supportsBeatDetection]` decompiles to:

```text
return clipType != 2;
```

So some sequence types are excluded before clip-level predicates even matter.

### `_supportsBeatGrid`

The most important gate is `-[FFAnchoredObject _supportsBeatGrid]`.

It immediately rejects any object that is:

- a video clip (`hasVideo == true`)
- a multicam object
- a reference clip
- a transition
- a synchronized clip

It also rejects some artistic retime cases. Constant artistic retime may still
pass, but non-constant artistic retime does not.

This single predicate explains most confusing UI behavior.

---

## Why A-V Clips Fail

This was the critical finding from the investigation:

FCP's built-in beat detection does not run on a normal A/V clip, even if that
clip contains clear music in its audio track.

If `hasVideo == true`, `_supportsBeatGrid` returns false, which means:

- `canDetectBeats == false`
- `canShowBeats == false`
- `canHideBeats == false`

That disables `Enable Beat Detection`.

### Why Expanding Audio Components Does Not Help

Expanding audio components is not enough.

The decompiled class `FFAudioComponentSource` returns `0` for:

- `canDetectBeats`
- `canShowBeats`
- `canHideBeats`

So selecting an expanded audio component does not satisfy the built-in beat-grid
command either.

The intended built-in workflow is an audio-only beat-grid-capable timeline
object, not a video clip with attached audio and not a component-source view of
that audio.

---

## What Happens After Detection Runs

When a clip passes validation, `detectBeatsOnSelection:` dispatches analysis
asynchronously through:

`+[FFEnableBeatGridCommand detectBeatsOnObjects:usingDelegate:enableBeatGrid:completionBlock:]`

That pipeline does the following:

1. Walks the selected primordial clips
2. Keeps clips that already `canShowBeats`
3. Collects clips that `canDetectBeats`
4. Groups those clips by representative asset `mediaIdentifier`
5. Calls `analyzeBeatsOnAssets:completionBlock:` on the delegate
6. Writes the resulting timing metadata back to the model under a model write lock
7. Optionally enables the beat grid immediately after metadata is written

The metadata write phase calls:

`setBeatTimeValues:barTimeValues:sectionTimeValues:tempo:`

So the built-in system stores four things on the clip model:

- beat times
- bar times
- section times
- tempo

If beat-grid enablement was requested and metadata was written successfully,
FCP enables the grid and may post `FFBeatGridSettingsChangedNotification`.

---

## Beat Grid UI States

`FFAudioBeatDetectionController` computes a simple four-state UI model in
`updateUI`:

- `0` = can detect beats
- `1` = can show beats
- `2` = can hide beats
- `3` = unsupported

This matches the three-way command behavior plus a disabled state.

SpliceKit runtime inspection also showed that a timeline with no active beat-grid
presentation can report `beatGridState = 0`, but the important actionable
predicates are still `canDetectBeats`, `canShowBeats`, and `canHideBeats`.

---

## Existing Beat Grid Metadata

Once a clip already has timing metadata:

- `canDetectBeats` becomes false
- `canShowBeats` becomes true when timing metadata exists and `beatGridEnabled == 0`
- `canHideBeats` becomes true when timing metadata exists and `beatGridEnabled != 0`

Decompiled logic:

```text
canShowBeats =
    _supportsBeatGrid
    && sequence.supportsBeatDetection
    && hasTimingMetadata
    && !beatGridEnabled

canHideBeats =
    _supportsBeatGrid
    && sequence.supportsBeatDetection
    && hasTimingMetadata
    && beatGridEnabled
```

So after analysis has been performed once, the same command toggles visibility
instead of re-running detection.

---

## AudioAnalysis Bridge

The original investigation stopped at Flexo's delegate call:

`FFEnableBeatGridCommand -> FFBeatDetectionCoordinator -> analyzeBeatsOnAssets:`

The missing middle layer is now confirmed to live in `AudioAnalysis.framework`.
That bridge is what turns an abstract FCP audio source into a
`MusicUnderstandingSession`, runs analysis, and translates the results back into
Objective-C objects that Flexo already knows how to write into the clip model.

### Confirmed Object Graph

The arm64 decompile shows this concrete object chain:

```text
FFEnableBeatGridCommand
  -> FFBeatDetectionCoordinator
    -> AABeatDetector
      -> MusicUnderstandingSessionAudioSourceProvider
      -> MusicUnderstandingSession
        -> RhythmProvider
        -> StructureProvider
      -> AnalysisResult
        -> AARhythmDetectionResult
        -> AAStructureDetectionResult
```

### Detector Construction

`-[AABeatDetector initWithSource:resultHandler:error:]` is a thin wrapper around
an internal helper that builds the actual session graph.

That helper does the following:

1. Clears detector state (`session`, `analysisTask`, `taskIsRunning`)
2. Stores the audio `source` and Objective-C `resultHandler`
3. Asks the source for its `sampleRate`
4. Builds an `AVAudioFormat`
5. Allocates `MusicUnderstandingSessionAudioSourceProvider(source, format)`
6. Initializes `MusicUnderstandingSession(audioProvider:)`

This is the previously missing proof that `AudioAnalysis` is the glue between
Flexo's `AABeatDetector` API and the Swift detector stack inside
`MusicUnderstandingEmbedded`.

### Async Task Split

`-[AABeatDetector start]` just calls Swift `BeatDetector.start()`, but the Swift
method immediately splits into two tasks:

1. An **analysis task** that owns the `MusicUnderstandingSession`
2. A **supervisor task** that waits for `analysisTask.result`

The split matters because the analysis task is responsible for collecting raw
Swift rhythm and structure results, while the supervisor task converts those
results into Objective-C `AARhythmDetectionResult` /
`AAStructureDetectionResult` instances and sends them to the delegate callback
selectors.

### AudioAnalysis Helper Map

The anonymous helpers in `AudioAnalysis` are now concrete enough to name by
role:

| Helper | Role |
|--------|------|
| `sub_F100` | Build `MusicUnderstandingSessionAudioSourceProvider` and `MusicUnderstandingSession` |
| `sub_E250` | Spawn the analysis task |
| `sub_E480` | Spawn the supervisor task |
| `sub_D8BC` | Main analysis task body |
| `sub_DC04` / `sub_DC4C` | Drain `RhythmProvider.rhythmResults` async stream into an array |
| `sub_DF3C` / `sub_DF84` | Drain `StructureProvider.structureResults` and build `AnalysisResult` |
| `sub_E6B8` / `sub_E7CC` | Await `analysisTask.result` from the supervisor |
| `sub_E81C` | Wrap Swift results as Objective-C objects and call `handleRhythmResult:` / `handleStructureResult:` |
| `sub_EBE0` / `sub_ED54` | Cancel running task and session |

---

## MusicUnderstanding Session Pipeline

The `MusicUnderstandingSession` side is now concrete enough to describe the
actual detector flow instead of stopping at "delegate analyzes assets."

### Session Launch

The analysis task body:

1. Loads the current `MusicUnderstandingSession` from `AABeatDetector.session`
2. Allocates `MusicUnderstandingSession.RhythmProvider`
3. Allocates `MusicUnderstandingSession.StructureProvider`
4. Packs those providers into an array of protocol-conforming analysis requests
5. Calls `MusicUnderstandingSession.runAnalysis(_:)`

At that point the session has everything it needs to analyze a source once and
publish two result streams:

- rhythm results
- structure results

### Result Collection

After `runAnalysis(_:)` returns, `AudioAnalysis` does not synchronously inspect a
single return object. Instead, it drains two async streams:

1. `RhythmProvider.rhythmResults`
2. `StructureProvider.structureResults`

Each stream is appended into a Swift array. When the structure stream finishes,
`AudioAnalysis` allocates an `AnalysisResult` object that simply holds:

- `rhythmResults`
- `structureResults`

The supervisor task then iterates those arrays and bridges them back into
Objective-C:

- each Swift `RhythmResult` becomes `AARhythmDetectionResult`
- each Swift `StructureResult` becomes `AAStructureDetectionResult`

Those are the objects that the Objective-C delegate methods
`handleRhythmResult:` and `handleStructureResult:` receive before Flexo writes
clip metadata.

### What the Session Actually Returns

The refreshed arm64 decompile confirms that the session-level result objects
line up exactly with the metadata Flexo expects later:

- `RhythmResult` exposes `beats`, `bars`, and `beatsPerMinute`
- `StructureResult` exposes `sections`, `segments`, and `phrases`

That matches the later model writeback in Flexo:

- beat times
- bar times
- section times
- tempo

### Concrete Built-In Beatmap Pipeline

With `Flexo`, `AudioAnalysis`, and `MusicUnderstandingEmbedded` combined, the
built-in beatmap path is now:

```text
detectBeatsOnSelection:
  -> FFEnableBeatGridCommand detects eligible clips
  -> FFBeatDetectionCoordinator groups clips by asset
  -> AABeatDetector builds MusicUnderstandingSession(audioProvider:)
  -> BeatDetector.start() launches analysis + supervisor tasks
  -> MusicUnderstandingSession.runAnalysis([RhythmProvider, StructureProvider])
  -> AudioAnalysis drains rhythm/structure async streams
  -> AudioAnalysis emits AARhythmDetectionResult / AAStructureDetectionResult
  -> Flexo writes beat/bar/section/BPM metadata to FFAnchoredObject
  -> Optional beat-grid enablement toggles visual presentation
```

---

## Standalone BeatTracker Path

`MusicUnderstandingEmbedded` also contains a lower-level `BeatTracker` path that
is useful for understanding the detector without any FCP or `AudioAnalysis`
wrapper logic around it.

### Convenience Entry Point

`BeatTracker.run(fileURL:)` is a simple wrapper:

1. Construct a temporary `BeatTracker`
2. Feed a file URL into it
3. Run the tracker
4. Destroy the temporary tracker

So the real work happens in the helper that reads the file and in
`BeatTracker.run()`.

### File Feeding

The file reader helper:

1. Opens `AVAudioFile`
2. Gets its `processingFormat`
3. Allocates one `AVAudioPCMBuffer` sized to the file length
4. Reads the file into that buffer
5. Converts the PCM data into the tracker's internal sample storage

The runtime helper map for that path is:

| Helper | Role |
|--------|------|
| `sub_DD40` | Open `AVAudioFile`, read the whole file, and feed PCM into the tracker |
| `sub_D7AC` | Append float channel data into the sample buffer and advance analyzed duration |
| `sub_D8F8` | Flush trailing buffered samples and mark end-of-input |
| `BeatTracker.sendAudio(buffer:)` | Public wrapper around `sub_D7AC` plus `BeatTracker.run()` |
| `BeatTracker.finishedSendingAudio()` | Public wrapper around `sub_D8F8` |

### Tracker Execution

The core tracker loop in `BeatTracker.run()` now reads as:

1. Pull buffered audio/features
2. Convert them into detector-ready representations
3. Accumulate intermediate analysis state
4. If enough evidence exists, or end-of-input has been reached, finalize a beat track
5. Choose between constant-tempo and variable-tempo output
6. Build a `BeatTrackerResult`
7. Trim beats to the actually analyzed duration

The most important anonymous helper in that finalization path is `sub_200F0`,
which logs either:

- "Choosing Constant Tempo."
- "Choosing Variable Tempo."

That is the clearest evidence in the current dump that the lower-level tracker
explicitly chooses between two tempo models before packaging its output.

### What Remains Anonymous

The pipeline is now understood end-to-end, but the inner ML and signal
processing math is still only partially named. In particular:

- `RhythmAnalyzer`
- `DownbeatTracker`
- some feature-building helpers reached from `BeatTracker.run()`

still fan out into many `sub_*` routines. The current arm64 pass is enough to
understand control flow and object boundaries, but not enough to assign nice
semantic names to every DSP / model-inference helper.

## SpliceKit's External `detect_beats()` Tool

SpliceKit also ships a completely separate beat analysis path:

```python
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/media.mp4")
```

This path is implemented by the standalone Swift tool in
`helpers/beat-detector.swift`.

Important differences from the built-in FCP path:

- it works on file paths, not timeline objects
- it accepts normal media files with video, as long as they contain audio
- it returns raw timestamps and BPM rather than mutating FCP clip metadata
- it bypasses FCP's beat-grid eligibility rules entirely

During investigation, this external path successfully analyzed a source MP4 that
FCP refused to analyze through `Enable Beat Detection`, producing a plausible BPM
and full beat/bar/section arrays.

This is the right fallback when:

- the music is embedded in an A/V clip
- FCP's menu item stays disabled
- you want timing data without changing timeline metadata

---

## Practical Workflows

### If You Want FCP's Built-In Beat Grid

Use an audio-only timeline object.

Recommended workflow:

1. Put the music on the timeline as a standalone audio-only clip
2. Select that audio-only clip
3. Run `Enable Beat Detection`
4. Use `Beat Detection Grid` once timing metadata exists

If the music currently lives inside a normal A/V clip:

1. Detach or otherwise isolate the audio into its own clip
2. Make sure the selected object is truly audio-only
3. Run beat detection on that audio-only object

### If You Only Need Beat Timing Data

Use the external detector:

```python
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/file.mp4")
```

This is the most reliable option for:

- music videos
- source MP4s with embedded soundtrack
- montage planning
- scripting that only needs timestamps and BPM

---

## Debugging Checklist

When `Enable Beat Detection` is disabled, check these in order:

1. Does the selected primordial clip return `canDetectBeats`?
2. If not, does it return `canShowBeats` or `canHideBeats`?
3. If all three are false, inspect:
   - `hasVideo`
   - `hasAudio`
   - `hasTimingMetadata`
   - `isFlexMusicObject`
   - sequence `supportsBeatDetection`
4. If `hasVideo == true`, that alone is enough to fail built-in detection
5. If you are only selecting expanded audio components, expect failure there too
6. If the source media has an audio track, verify it with `detect_beats(file_path=...)`

Useful runtime probes through SpliceKit:

```python
call_method_with_args(target=clip, selector="canDetectBeats", args="[]")
call_method_with_args(target=clip, selector="canShowBeats", args="[]")
call_method_with_args(target=clip, selector="canHideBeats", args="[]")
call_method_with_args(target=clip, selector="_supportsBeatGrid", args="[]")
call_method_with_args(target=clip, selector="hasTimingMetadata", args="[]")
call_method_with_args(target=assetRef, selector="originalMediaURL", args="[]")
detect_beats(file_path="/resolved/source/file.mp4")
```

---

## Bottom Line

The built-in FCP beat grid is not a generic "analyze whatever audio is attached
to this clip" feature.

It is a model-level feature for beat-grid-capable timeline objects, and those
objects are effectively audio-only. A normal video clip with music embedded in
its audio track will fail the built-in predicate even if the audio itself is
perfectly suitable for beat analysis.

SpliceKit's external `detect_beats()` tool does not have that limitation, which
makes it the better option whenever the source media is an A/V file.
