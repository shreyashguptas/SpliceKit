# FCPXML Paste and the FCP Pasteboard

How SpliceKit gets FCPXML onto a timeline through Final Cut Pro's paste, and what
was learned about FCP's pasteboard along the way. Two parts:

1. **FCPXML direct paste** — the `pasteAnchored:` / `paste:` swizzle that converts
   FCPXML on the pasteboard into FCP's native clipboard format before the paste runs.
   This is what `paste_fcpxml`, `generate_captions` and `timeline_action("paste")` rely on.
   Added April 2026 against FCP 12.0 (screen freeze, caching, consolidated function,
   `paste:` support and playhead restore are all implemented).
2. **Pasteboard and media linking** — April 2026 research (FCP 11.1) into which
   pasteboard types FCP accepts and how clip attributes survive a paste.

---

## Part 1: FCPXML direct paste

### Problem

FCP's `pasteAnchored:` only handles native `proFFPasteboardUTI` clipboard data —
a binary `NSKeyedArchiver` plist containing serialized `FFPasteboardItem` objects.
When FCPXML is on the pasteboard (from `paste_fcpxml`, `generate_captions`, or
external tools), `pasteAnchored:` silently ignores it.

The caption system previously worked around this with a 6-step pipeline:
1. Build FCPXML with titles
2. Import via `FFXMLTranslationTask` → creates temp project
3. `loadEditorForSequence:` → switch to temp project
4. `selectAll:` + `copy:` → serialize to native clipboard
5. `loadEditorForSequence:` → switch back to user project
6. `pasteAnchored:` → paste native data

This took ~6 seconds with visible project switching, multiple sleep/poll cycles,
and fragile state management.

### Solution: `pasteAnchored:` Swizzle

SpliceKit swizzles `-[FFAnchoredTimelineModule pasteAnchored:]` to transparently
convert FCPXML to native clipboard format before the original paste runs.

#### How It Works

```
User calls paste_fcpxml() or timeline_action("pasteAsConnected") / ("paste")
  → pasteAnchored: or paste: fires
    → SpliceKit_handleFCPXMLPaste() checks hasEdits: on pasteboard
      → YES: call original (normal native paste)
      → NO: call SpliceKit_convertFCPXMLToNativeClipboard()
        → Check containsXML? NO → return, call original
        → Check cache (FNV-1a hash of XML + library UUID)
          → HIT: write cached native data to pasteboard, return YES
          → MISS: continue with import pipeline
        → Save playhead position
        → Freeze screen (NSDisableScreenUpdates + 8s safety timeout)
        → Inject unique project name (_SKPaste_XXXXX)
        → Import via FFXMLTranslationTask
        → Poll _deepLoadedSequences for new project (by name)
        → loadEditorForSequence: → switch to temp project
        → selectAll: + copy: → native data on pasteboard
        → Cache the native data for future pastes
        → Switch back to user project, restore playhead
        → Clean up temp project
        → Unfreeze screen
      → Call original paste (now finds native data)
```

#### Key Design Decisions

**Shared conversion function** (`SpliceKit_convertFCPXMLToNativeClipboard`)

The core conversion logic is a standalone function callable from both the
paste swizzles and the caption system. Declared in `Sources/Core/SpliceKit.h` for use
by the caption panel (`Sources/Panels/Captions/`). Returns YES if native data is on the pasteboard.

**Both paste modes swizzled** (Improvement #8)

`pasteAnchored:` (paste as connected) and `paste:` (insert paste) are both
swizzled through a shared handler `SpliceKit_handleFCPXMLPaste()`. Both go
through the same `_addItemsWithPasteboard:` internal path with different
`pasteMode` values.

**Screen freeze** (Improvement #3)

`NSDisableScreenUpdates()` hides the brief project switch flicker. A
`dispatch_after` safety timeout of 8 seconds ensures the screen unfreezes
even if the pipeline hangs.

**Caching** (Improvement #6)

Native clipboard data is cached in an `NSCache` keyed by `libraryUUID_hash`.
The FNV-1a hash of the FCPXML string provides fast, collision-resistant
lookup. Cache has a 50MB cost limit (~3,000 typical clips). Repeat pastes
of the same FCPXML skip the entire import pipeline.

**Playhead restoration** (Improvement #10)

The playhead position is saved before the project switch and restored after
switching back, ensuring pastes land at the expected timeline position.

**Swizzle point: `pasteAnchored:`/`paste:` not `editsFromPasteboard:`**

`editsFromPasteboard:` is called while holding FFModelLock's write lock.
Switching projects while holding that lock would deadlock. The paste methods
are called before the lock, giving us freedom to switch projects.

**Unique project name injection**

The FCPXML's `<project name="...">` is replaced with `_SKPaste_XXXXX` via
regex before import. This ensures we find our exact temp project in
`_deepLoadedSequences`, even when the library contains dozens of old
temp projects from previous caption runs.

**Run loop pumping instead of sleep**

The swizzle runs on the main thread. Using `[NSThread sleep:]` would block
the run loop and prevent FCP from processing the import. We use
`[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate:]` to pump events between polls.

#### Consolidation with Caption System (Improvement #7)

`addCaptionTitlesDirectlyToTimeline` (now in `Sources/Panels/Captions/SpliceKitCaptionPanel+Timeline.m`) has its own
import-switch-copy-paste pipeline. It can be refactored to use the shared
`SpliceKit_convertFCPXMLToNativeClipboard()`, keeping only the caption-specific
post-processing (position offset, text verification). See the NOTE comment
at the top of that method for the refactoring plan.

### FCP Internal Architecture (from decompilation)

#### The Paste Call Chain

```
pasteAnchored:
  v7 = NSPasteboardNameGeneral
  skimmingTime → atTime
  _addItemsWithPasteboard:atTime:pasteMode:backtimed:useSelectedRange:
    trackType:container:changesUnderActionHandler:
      FFPasteboard.initWithName: (wraps general pasteboard)
      FFModelLock._writeLock
      FFAnchoredSequence.editsFromPasteboard:trackType:videoProps:
        displayDropFrame:isLoneTransition:userInfoMap:
          FFPasteboard.hasEdits: → checks for native data categories
          FFPasteboard.newEditsWithProject:mediaByReferenceOnly:options:
            → _newObjectsWithProject:assetFlags:fromURL:options:userInfoMap:
              → _newObjectsWithProjectCore: (THE CORE)
      FFPasteboard.newMarkersWithProject:options:
      FFModelLock._writeUnlock
      FFAnchoredSequence.actionAddItemsOnPasteboard:editsToAdd:videoProps:
        displayDropFrame:atTime:pasteMode:backtimed:rangeOfMedia:rootItem:
        needsMediaReferencesChecking:needsConsolidatedEffectsChecking:error:
```

#### FCP's Built-in FCPXML Paste Path (Blocked)

`_newObjectsWithProjectCore:` at address `0x4B5640` in Flexo actually HAS
complete FCPXML import handling:

```c
// At LABEL_59: No FFPasteboardItem found
if ([pasteboard containsXML]) {
    task = [FFXMLTranslationTask translationTaskForPasteboard:pb];
    if (task && !task.error && task.contentType == 2) {
        // Set up import options, import, get clips
        [task importClipsWithOptions:options taskDelegate:delegate];
        imported = [task clipsAndRangesImportedInEvent:targetEvent];
        for (item in imported) {
            if (!item.object.isProject) result.add(item);
        }
    }
}
```

**Three gates prevent this from working:**

| Gate | Where | What blocks |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `hasEdits:` | `editsFromPasteboard:` | Returns NO for FCPXML → `newEditsWithProject:` never called |
| `contentType == 2` | `_newObjectsWithProjectCore:` | Only `<project>`-rooted FCPXML passes (not `<library>` wrapped) |
| `!isProject` filter | `_newObjectsWithProjectCore:` | Imported project objects are excluded → 0 clips returned |

No FCPXML structure satisfies all three simultaneously:
- `<library>` wrapped → contentType=0 (fails gate 2)
- `<event>` wrapped → contentType=1 (fails gate 2)
- `<project>` only → contentType=2 (passes gate 2, but all imports are project objects → fails gate 3)
- Spine-only → contentType varies, rejected by `importClipsWithOptions:` entirely

#### Native Clipboard Format

When FCP copies clips, the pasteboard contains exactly one type:
`com.apple.flexo.proFFPasteboardUTI`

The data is an `NSKeyedArchiver` binary plist (~15KB) with three top-level keys:

| Key | Content |
|-----|---------|
| `ffpasteboardobject` | NSKeyedArchiver data (FFAnchoredMediaComponent, FFAsset, FFEffectStack, etc.) |
| `ffpasteboardcopiedtypes` | Metadata dict (e.g. `{"pb_anchoredObject": {"count": 1}}`) |
| `kffmodelobjectIDs` | Empty array |

The library document ID is embedded inside the NSKeyedArchiver data, not at top level.

#### Key Methods

| Method | Class | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `hasEdits:` | FFPasteboard | Checks for native edit/anchoredObject categories |
| `newEditsWithProject:mediaByReferenceOnly:options:userInfoMap:` | FFPasteboard | Deserializes native data → clip objects |
| `writeAnchoredObjects:options:` | FFPasteboard | Serializes clip objects → native pasteboard format |
| `containsXML` | NSPasteboard (Interchange) | Checks for FCPXML on pasteboard |
| `initForPasteboard:` | FFXMLTranslationTask | Parses FCPXML from pasteboard |
| `importClipsWithOptions:` | FFXMLTranslationTask | Imports parsed FCPXML into library |
| `importedEvents` | FFXMLTranslationTask | Returns FFMediaEventProject array of imported events |
| `allImportedClipsAndRanges` | FFXMLTranslationTask | Returns FigTimeRangeAndObject set (often empty) |
| `editsFromPasteboard:trackType:videoProps:displayDropFrame:isLoneTransition:userInfoMap:` | FFAnchoredSequence | Main paste pipeline entry point |
| `loadEditorForSequence:` | PEEditorContainerModule | Switches active timeline |
| `_deepLoadedSequences` | FFLibrary | Returns all loaded sequences in library |

#### FCPXML Pasteboard Types

| Type | UTI String | Required? |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Generic | `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml` | YES — must be present for paste |
| v1-12 | `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-12` | Optional |
| v1-13 | `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-13` | Optional |
| v1-14 | `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-14` | Optional (FCP 11.1+) |

Note: v1-11 and earlier are NOT in FCP's readable types. Generic alone is sufficient.
Version-specific UTI alone (without generic) does NOT enable paste.

#### FCPXML contentType Values

| Value | Root element | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | `<library>` | Rejected by contentType check |
| 1 | `<event>` | Rejected by contentType check |
| 2 | `<project>` | Passes check but imports as project (filtered out) |

### Files

| File | What |
|------|------|
| `Sources/Bridge/SpliceKitServerFCPXML.m` | Swizzle implementation (`SpliceKit_swizzled_pasteAnchored`) |
| `Sources/Core/SpliceKit.h` | Function declaration (`SpliceKit_installFCPXMLPasteSwizzle`) |
| `Sources/Core/SpliceKit.m` | Install call in `SpliceKit_appDidLaunch()` |

### Tested Approaches (What Didn't Work)

| # | Approach | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Spine-only FCPXML → `importClipsWithOptions:` | Rejected — needs `<library>` wrapper |
| 2 | FCPXML on pasteboard → `pasteAnchored:` directly | Silently ignored — needs native format |
| 3 | Full FCPXML matching existing project name | Creates separate project, no merge |
| 4 | FCPXML → `anchorWithPasteboard:` | No effect (expects effect IDs, not XML) or crash |
| 5 | `FFXMLTranslationTask.exportToPasteboard:` → paste | Exports XML format, not native |
| 6 | Direct model copy (`addAnchoredItemsObject:`) | Objects can't be moved between sequences |
| 7 | `timelineView:addItems:toPasteboardWithName:` | Items from unloaded sequences are empty stubs |
| 8 | `writeAnchoredObjects:options:` with spine items | Writes native data but spine gaps don't paste as connected |
| 9 | Swizzle `hasEdits:` to unlock built-in FCPXML path | contentType + isProject gates still block |

## Part 2: Pasteboard and media linking (historical research)

> **Historical research.** These findings come from April 2026 testing against FCP 11.1
> on macOS Sequoia 15.4, using NSPasteboard from a Swift CLI and, at the time, AppleScript
> to activate FCP and send Cmd+V / Cmd+Z. SpliceKit no longer allows AppleScript or
> synthetic keystrokes (see `.claude/CLAUDE.md`); the AppleScript steps below record how
> the experiments were run, not a method to reuse. Paste from code through the bridge
> (`paste_fcpxml`, `timeline_action("paste")`).

### Tested Findings Summary

#### What Works

| Approach | Result |
|----------|--------|
| FCPXML on `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml` (generic UTI) | **Works** — media imported, project created |
| FCPXML on generic + versioned UTIs (recommended) | **Works** |
| FCPXML version 1.14 with `v1-14` UTI | **Works** |
| FCPXML audio clip with `adjust-volume` | **Works** — volume restored via bridge post-import |
| FCPXML video clip with `adjust-volume` | **Works** — video + audio imported correctly |
| FCPXML with `audioRole="effects"` | **Works** |
| FCPXML with multiple clips (3 different assets) | **Works** — all clips imported |
| FCPXML with `<marker>` and `<chapter-marker>` | **Works** — markers preserved at correct times (verified via nextMarker navigation) |
| FCPXML with connected clips (`lane="1"`) | **Works** — primary + connected clip imported |
| FCPXML with `<timeMap>` (retiming/speed) | **Works** — clip imported (speed verification pending) |
| Volume restore via `inspector.set` after import | **Works** — `inspector.set("volume", -8)` confirmed |

#### What Doesn't Work

| Approach | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Version-specific UTI alone (e.g., `v1-11` without generic) | Paste NOT enabled |
| FCPXML as `public.utf8-plain-text` | Paste NOT enabled |
| `adjust-blend` (opacity) on audio-only clip | **Import fails** — "The dragged XML could not be imported" |
| `adjust-blend` on video clip | **Import fails** — same error (even with valid video asset) |
| File URL paste via bridge `paste:` | **Does not add clips** — bridge paste: ignores URLs |
| `newEditsWithProject:mediaByReferenceOnly:` | **Crashes FCP** — causes TLKMarkerLayer exception |
| Multi-clip per-clip volume (different volumes each) | **Partial** — all clips imported but bridge applies last volume to all selected |
| `adjust-volume` preserved by import itself | **No** — always defaults to 0dB, must use post-import `inspector.set` |

#### Crashes Found

- **Markers + layout**: Importing FCPXML with markers can crash FCP during timeline layout.
  Crash in `TLKMarkerLayer layoutSublayers` → `CALayer setPosition:` with NaN/Inf position.
  The markers are imported correctly (verified via `nextMarker`) but can crash on render.
- **`newEditsWithProject:mediaByReferenceOnly:options:`**: Calling this on FFPasteboard with FCPXML
  data crashes FCP. This method is not a viable path for timeline insertion.

#### Native Clipboard Format (Corrections from Testing)

When FCP copies a clip, the pasteboard contains **exactly one type**: `com.apple.flexo.proFFPasteboardUTI`.
No FCPXML types are written. No promise types.

The plist has **only 3 keys** (not 6 as originally documented):

| Key | Observed |
|-----|----------|
| `ffpasteboardobject` | **NSKeyedArchiver** binary plist (15K+ bytes), NOT FFCoder |
| `ffpasteboardcopiedtypes` | e.g., `{"pb_anchoredObject": {"count": 1}}` |
| `kffmodelobjectIDs` | Empty array `[]` |

**Not observed at top level**: `ffpasteboarddocumentID`, `ffpasteboardparentobjectID`, `ffpasteboardoptions`.
The library document ID IS embedded inside the `ffpasteboardobject` NSKeyedArchiver data (confirmed by
finding the library UUID `2418FDEA-...` matching the active library).

The NSKeyedArchiver data contains 265 objects including these classes:
`FFAnchoredMediaComponent`, `FFAnchoredCollection`, `FFAsset`, `FFAssetRef`, `FFEffectStack`,
`FFHeColorEffect`, `FFHeConformEffect`, `FFIntrinsicColorConformEffect`, `FFMediaRep`,
`FFMediaResource`, `FFMediaResourceMap`, `FFAudioClipComponentsLayoutMap`, `FFObjectDict`.

#### Behavioral Notes

- **No new event created**: FCPXML paste with `<library><event name="Paste Test">` does NOT create
  a visible event in the sidebar. Clips are appended directly to the current timeline's spine.
- **Undo name varies**: FCP reports the paste as "Append to Storyline" or "Add Media" depending
  on timeline state and whether a project was active.
- **Generic UTI is required**: The versioned UTI (e.g., `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11`) alone
  is NOT sufficient — FCP's paste handler requires the generic `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml`.
- **Attribute preservation FAILED**: Inspector verification (via flexo bridge) confirms that
  `adjust-volume amount="-10dB"` in FCPXML is **NOT applied** after import. The clip's volume
  reads as 1.0 (0dB) — default. The import creates the project/clip correctly but ignores
  per-clip adjustments like volume. This means Solution 1's FCPXML attributes require
  post-import restoration via `set_inspector_property()` (same as Solution 3).
- **Bridge `paste:` doesn't handle FCPXML**: The bridge's `timeline.action("paste")` sends `paste:`
  to the editor container, which only handles native `FFPasteboardItem` data. FCPXML on the pasteboard
  is silently ignored. **Fix added**: The bridge now detects FCPXML on the pasteboard and routes
  through `FFXMLTranslationTask.initForPasteboard:` + `importClipsWithOptions:` instead.
- **`fcpxml.import` triggers library dialog**: The `openXMLDocumentWithURL:` path shows a blocking
  "Which library?" dialog. The new `fcpxml.pasteImport` method bypasses this by importing directly
  into the current project's event.
- **FFPasteboard readable types (FCP 11.1)**: v1-12, v1-13, v1-14 only. v1-11 and earlier are NOT
  in the readable types list. Use v1-14 for current FCP versions.
- **`containsXML` confirmed working**: NSPasteboard extension from Interchange framework correctly
  detects FCPXML data. `isNative` correctly returns NO for non-native content.

---

### The Problem

When building an extension that saves SFX (or any clips) from the FCP timeline and later restores them, you hit a fundamental conflict in how Final Cut Pro handles clipboard data:

**Path A — Paste via file URL**: FCP accepts the file and places the clip on the timeline, but **ignores saved volume, effects, and other attributes**. It treats the URL as a fresh media import and creates a new clip with default properties.

**Path B — Paste stored FCP clipboard data**: The native clipboard data has volume, effects, and attributes baked in, but FCP **rejects it if the referenced media file isn't already linked in the project**. The clip appears offline.

The root cause is that FCP's native clipboard format stores **media references** (document IDs, parent object IDs, persistent IDs), not the actual media. At paste time, FCP resolves these references against the current project library. If the media isn't linked, resolution fails.

---

### How FCP's Pasteboard System Works

#### Three-Layer Architecture

1. **IXXMLPasteboardType** (Interchange framework) — Defines UTI type strings for FCPXML data on the pasteboard. Class methods like `current`, `previous`, `generic`, `string` each return a UTI string for a specific FCPXML version.

2. **FFPasteboardItem** (Flexo framework) — The serialized clipboard item. Implements `NSPasteboardWriting`, `NSPasteboardReading`, and `NSSecureCoding`. Stores encoded clip data as a property list.

3. **FFPasteboard** (Flexo framework) — The coordinator with 76 methods. Reads/writes `FFPasteboardItem` objects to/from the underlying `NSPasteboard`.

#### Native Clipboard Data Format

When FCP writes clips to the pasteboard, `FFPasteboardItem` serializes them as an `NSPropertyList` dictionary.

**Observed keys** (tested April 2026, FCP 11.1):

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `ffpasteboardobject` | NSData | **NSKeyedArchiver**-encoded clip objects (all attributes, media refs, effects) |
| `ffpasteboardcopiedtypes` | NSDictionary | Metadata about what was copied (e.g., `{"pb_anchoredObject": {"count": 1}}`) |
| `kffmodelobjectIDs` | NSArray | Object identifiers for lazy/promise resolution (observed: empty array) |

**Not observed at top level** (may appear in other copy contexts or older FCP versions):

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `ffpasteboarddocumentID` | NSString | Source library's unique identifier (embedded inside `ffpasteboardobject` instead) |
| `ffpasteboardparentobjectID` | NSString | Parent container's persistent ID |
| `ffpasteboardoptions` | NSDictionary | Paste options |

> **Correction**: The `ffpasteboardobject` data uses **NSKeyedArchiver** (binary plist with `$version`,
> `$archiver`, `$top`, `$objects` keys), not FFCoder. The archive contains a full object graph with
> classes like `FFAnchoredMediaComponent`, `FFAsset`, `FFEffectStack`, etc. The library document ID
> is embedded inside this archive, not as a separate top-level key.

#### The UTI Types

**Native (internal)**: `com.apple.flexo.proFFPasteboardUTI` (Pro version). A separate consumer/iMovie variant exists. A promise UTI also exists for deferred data loading.

**FCPXML (public, documented by Apple)**:
- **Generic**: `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml` — always supported
- **Version-specific** (FCP 10.5+): `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-8`, `.v1-9`, `.v1-10`, `.v1-11`, `.v1-12`, `.v1-13`, `.v1-14`
- FCP looks for the **highest version-specific type** first; falls back to generic if not found
- When writing, FCP places the current DTD version on both the generic type and all versioned types
- **Tested**: The generic UTI `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml` is **required** for paste. A version-specific
  UTI alone (e.g., only `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11`) does NOT enable FCP's paste command.

These public UTI strings are what `IXXMLPasteboardType.current`, `.generic`, etc. return internally. You can use the public strings directly without runtime discovery.

#### Readable Types (What FCP Accepts on Paste)

FCP's `+[FFPasteboard readableTypes]` registers these types in order:

1. `FFPasteboardUTI` (native FCP format — pro or consumer)
2. `NSPasteboardTypeURL` (file URLs)
3. `[IXXMLPasteboardType all]` (all FCPXML version UTIs — the `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.*` types listed above)
4. `NSFilePromiseReceiver` readable types

---

### The Two Paste Paths (Critical Discovery)

FCP's core paste decoder (`_newObjectsWithProjectCore:assetFlags:fromURL:options:userInfoMap:`) has **two completely separate code paths**:

#### Path 1: Native FFPasteboardItem

```
If pasteboard contains FFPasteboardUTI type:
  1. Read FFPasteboardItem objects from pasteboard
  2. Resolve documentID against open library documents
  3. Decode via NSKeyedUnarchiver → FCP model objects
  4. If documentID doesn't match current library → OFFLINE / FAIL
```

> **Tested**: When FCP copies a clip, it places **exactly one type** on the pasteboard:
> `com.apple.flexo.proFFPasteboardUTI`. No FCPXML types, no promise types, no file URLs.
> The data is 15K+ bytes of NSKeyedArchiver-encoded objects (not FFCoder).

This is why stored clipboard data fails — the `documentID` (embedded inside the NSKeyedArchiver
data) and other object references target a library state that no longer matches, or the media
asset isn't registered in the current project.

#### Path 2: FCPXML on Pasteboard

```
If pasteboard does NOT contain FFPasteboardItem
  BUT pasteboard contains XML (IXXMLPasteboardType):
    1. Create FFXMLTranslationTask from pasteboard data
    2. Validate contentType == sequence/clip data
    3. Create FFXMLImportOptions:
       - incrementalImport = YES (adds to existing library)
       - conflictResolutionType = 3 (merge, don't replace)
       - Target = current project's defaultMediaEvent
    4. Run importClipsWithOptions:taskDelegate:
    5. MEDIA IS AUTOMATICALLY IMPORTED from src= URLs
    6. Return imported clips as FigTimeRangeAndObject items
```

**This is the key**: when FCP finds FCPXML on the pasteboard instead of native `FFPasteboardItem` data, it runs the **full XML import pipeline** — which handles media file linking automatically.

---

### Solution 1: FCPXML Pasteboard (Recommended) ✅ TESTED

Write FCPXML data directly to `NSPasteboard` using `IXXMLPasteboardType` UTI strings. FCP's XML paste path will import the media and preserve all attributes declared in the XML.

> **Tested April 2026**: This approach works. FCPXML on the generic pasteboard UTI
> `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml` enables FCP's paste command and triggers the "Append to Storyline"
> or "Add Media" undo action. Tested with audio files (system sounds), volume adjustments,
> opacity, and audioRole attributes. No new events are created in the sidebar — clips go
> directly into the active timeline's spine.

#### Step 1: Use the Public FCPXML Pasteboard UTI

Apple documents these pasteboard types publicly. No runtime discovery needed:

```objc
// Public UTI strings — documented by Apple for workflow extensions and drag-and-drop
NSString *genericType = @"com.apple.finalcutpro.xml";           // Always works
NSString *versionType = @"com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11";    // Version-specific

// Alternatively, resolve at runtime from FCP's Interchange framework:
Class IXType = objc_getClass("IXXMLPasteboardType");
NSString *currentType = [IXType performSelector:@selector(current)];
NSArray  *allTypes    = [IXType performSelector:@selector(all)];
```

FCP checks for the highest version-specific type first, then falls back to generic. For maximum compatibility, write to both the versioned type and the generic type.

> **Tested**: The generic UTI is **mandatory**. Writing only `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11`
> (without the generic type) leaves FCP's Paste menu item disabled. Always include the generic type.

#### Step 2: Build FCPXML with Asset + Attributes

```objc
NSString *fcpxml = [NSString stringWithFormat:
    @"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n"
    @"<!DOCTYPE fcpxml>\n"
    @"<fcpxml version=\"1.11\">\n"
    @"  <resources>\n"
    @"    <format id=\"r0\" frameDuration=\"1/24s\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"/>\n"
    @"    <asset id=\"r1\" hasAudio=\"1\" hasVideo=\"0\"\n"
    @"           audioSources=\"1\" audioChannels=\"2\" audioRate=\"48000\">\n"
    @"      <media-rep kind=\"original-media\" src=\"%@\"/>\n"
    @"    </asset>\n"
    @"  </resources>\n"
    @"  <library>\n"
    @"    <event name=\"Restored SFX\">\n"
    @"      <project name=\"_paste_temp\">\n"
    @"        <sequence format=\"r0\" duration=\"%@\">\n"
    @"          <spine>\n"
    @"            <asset-clip ref=\"r1\" name=\"%@\" duration=\"%@\"\n"
    @"                        start=\"0s\" format=\"r0\"\n"
    @"                        audioRole=\"effects\">\n"
    @"              <adjust-volume amount=\"%@dB\"/>\n"
    @"            </asset-clip>\n"
    @"          </spine>\n"
    @"        </sequence>\n"
    @"      </project>\n"
    @"    </event>\n"
    @"  </library>\n"
    @"</fcpxml>",
    fileURL,          // file:///path/to/sfx.wav
    durationStr,      // e.g., "240/24s" or "10s"
    clipName,         // display name
    durationStr,      // clip duration
    volumeStr];       // e.g., "-6" for -6dB
```

> **Note**: The `<media-rep>` element inside `<asset>` is the official way to reference media files (per Apple's FCPXML spec). The `kind="original-media"` attribute tells FCP this is the original source file. The `audioRole` attribute on `<asset-clip>` assigns the audio role (e.g., `dialogue`, `music`, `effects`).

FCPXML supports a wide range of attributes:

```xml
<!-- Volume -->
<adjust-volume amount="-6dB"/>

<!-- Audio Panning (mode: 0=Default, 1=Stereo L/R, 2=Create Space, 3=Dialogue, 4=Music, 5=Ambience) -->
<adjust-panner mode="1" amount="-50"/>

<!-- Effects (ref points to an effect resource) -->
<filter-video ref="r2" name="Gaussian Blur">
    <param name="Amount" key="9999/gaussianBlur/radius" value="10"/>
</filter-video>
<filter-audio ref="r3" name="Channel EQ">
    <data key="effectData">[base64-encoded AU state]</data>
</filter-audio>

<!-- Transform (position/scale as % of frame height, rotation in degrees) -->
<adjust-transform position="100 50" scale="1.2 1.2" rotation="15" anchor="0 0"/>

<!-- Opacity / Blend Mode (amount: 0.0-1.0, mode: integer — see blend mode table) -->
<adjust-blend amount="0.75" mode="14"/>
```

#### Step 3: Write to Pasteboard

```objc
NSData *xmlData = [fcpxml dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
NSPasteboard *pb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
[pb clearContents];

// Write to both generic and version-specific types for maximum compatibility
[pb setData:xmlData forType:@"com.apple.finalcutpro.xml"];
[pb setData:xmlData forType:@"com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11"];
```

#### Step 3 (Alternative): Use the Official Promise Pattern

Apple's documented approach for workflow extensions uses `NSPasteboardItemDataProvider` to lazily provide FCPXML data. This is the official way to drag clips into FCP:

```objc
// In your data provider class:
@interface MyPasteboardProvider : NSObject <NSPasteboardItemDataProvider>
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *fcpxml;
@end

@implementation MyPasteboardProvider
- (void)pasteboard:(NSPasteboard *)pasteboard
              item:(NSPasteboardItem *)item
provideDataForType:(NSPasteboardType)type {
    NSData *xmlData = [self.fcpxml dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    [item setData:xmlData forType:type];
}
@end

// Usage:
NSPasteboardItem *pbItem = [[NSPasteboardItem alloc] init];
MyPasteboardProvider *provider = [[MyPasteboardProvider alloc] init];
provider.fcpxml = fcpxml;
[pbItem setDataProvider:provider
               forTypes:@[@"com.apple.finalcutpro.xml",
                          @"com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11"]];

NSPasteboard *pb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
[pb clearContents];
[pb writeObjects:@[pbItem]];
```

This is particularly useful for drag-and-drop: FCP requests the FCPXML only when the drop occurs, not when the drag starts.

#### Step 4: Trigger Paste

Either let the user Cmd+V, or programmatically:

```objc
id timelineModule = /* get active FFAnchoredTimelineModule */;
[timelineModule performSelector:@selector(paste:) withObject:nil];
```

#### What Happens Internally

1. FCP checks for `FFPasteboardItem` → not found
2. Checks for XML types via `containsXML` → found (your FCPXML data)
3. `FFXMLTranslationTask` reads the XML, tries types in order: `current`, `previous`, `previousPrevious`, `generic`, falls back to `string`
4. Parses with `FFXML.importXMLData:version:contentType:error:`
5. Creates `FFXMLImportOptions` with `incrementalImport:YES`, `conflictResolutionType:3`
6. Sets target to the current project's `defaultMediaEvent`
7. Runs `importClipsWithOptions:taskDelegate:` — this resolves the `src=` URL, imports the media file, creates `FFAsset` entries
8. Returns imported clips ready for timeline insertion

> **Tested behavior**: Steps confirmed. The entire cycle takes ~2 seconds for a small audio
> file. The undo action is "Append to Storyline" (sometimes "Add Media"). No separate event
> is created in the library sidebar despite the FCPXML containing `<event name="Paste Test">` —
> the clips are merged directly into the active timeline.

#### FCP Drop/Paste Behavior (per Apple docs)

How FCP handles FCPXML content depends on what the XML describes:

| FCPXML Contains | FCP Does |
|-----------------|----------|
| Clips dragged to timeline | Adds to event containing open project; inserts at drop/playhead point |
| Events | Merges into library; handles naming conflicts with numerical suffixes |
| Clips/projects to event | Adds items; prompts on name conflicts |
| Clips/projects to library | Creates dated event (e.g., "06-29-19"); adds items |
| Library | Merges all content using naming conflict rules |

#### Advantages

- **Tested**: Media import works — clips are created with correct media references
- **Tested**: No offline clips — FCP resolves `src=` URLs and imports media automatically
- **Tested**: No library selection dialog when `setLibrary:` is set on FFXMLImportOptions
- **Tested**: Incremental import — merges into existing library

#### Limitations

- **Tested**: Per-clip attributes (`adjust-volume`, `adjust-blend`, etc.) are **NOT preserved** by the import.
  Inspector shows default values (volume=1.0, opacity=1.0) after import despite FCPXML containing adjustments.
  Attributes must be restored programmatically after import via `set_inspector_property()`.
- **Tested**: Import creates a **new project/sequence** — it does NOT insert clips into the current timeline.
  Each import creates a new project entry in the library sidebar.
- **Tested**: The generic UTI `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml` must always be included. Versioned UTI alone doesn't work.
- Very complex custom effect parameters may require additional FCPXML authoring.

---

### Solution 2: Two-Step Import Then Paste (Fallback) — NOT TESTED

If you need to preserve the exact native clipboard data (with complex attributes that FCPXML can't express), import the media first so the native paste succeeds.

> **Note**: This approach requires modifying internal FCP data structures. The native clipboard
> format uses NSKeyedArchiver (not FFCoder as originally assumed), making the `ffpasteboardobject`
> data harder to manipulate than a simple plist. The document ID patching described below may not
> work as written because the ID is inside the NSKeyedArchiver archive, not a top-level plist key.

#### Step 1: Import Media to Library

Import the file into the current project's library so FCP creates an `FFAsset` for it:

```objc
// Option A: Via FFPasteboard with URL
NSPasteboard *tempPB = [NSPasteboard pasteboardWithUniqueName];
[tempPB clearContents];
[tempPB writeObjects:@[[NSURL fileURLWithPath:sfxFilePath]]];

Class FFPasteboardClass = objc_getClass("FFPasteboard");
id ffpb = [[FFPasteboardClass alloc]
    performSelector:@selector(initWithPasteboard:) withObject:tempPB];

id timelineModule = /* active timeline module */;
id sequence = [timelineModule performSelector:@selector(sequence)];

// This imports the media into the project library
[ffpb performSelector:@selector(newMediaWithSequence:fromURL:options:)
           withObject:sequence withObject:nil withObject:nil];
```

```objc
// Option B: Via FCPXML file import (more reliable)
// Write a minimal FCPXML to a temp file, then:
id appController = [NSApp performSelector:@selector(delegate)];
NSURL *xmlURL = /* temp FCPXML file URL */;
[appController performSelector:@selector(openXMLDocumentWithURL:bundleURL:display:sender:)
                    withObject:xmlURL withObject:nil withObject:@NO withObject:nil];
```

#### Step 2: Patch documentID (If Needed)

Your stored clipboard data may have a `documentID` from a different library session. Patch it:

> **⚠️ Correction from testing**: The `ffpasteboarddocumentID` key was NOT observed as a
> top-level plist key in FCP 11.1. The document ID is embedded INSIDE the `ffpasteboardobject`
> NSKeyedArchiver data. Simple plist-level patching as shown below may not work. You would need
> to decode the NSKeyedArchiver, find the UUID string in the `$objects` array, replace it, and
> re-encode. This is fragile.

```objc
// Read the current library's unique identifier
id currentProject = /* current project */;
id projectDoc = [currentProject performSelector:@selector(projectDocument)];
NSString *currentDocID = [projectDoc performSelector:@selector(uniqueIdentifier)];

// ⚠️ This simple approach may not work — documentID is inside NSKeyedArchiver, not top-level
NSMutableDictionary *plist = [NSPropertyListSerialization
    propertyListWithData:storedPlistData
    options:NSPropertyListMutableContainers
    format:NULL error:NULL];
plist[@"ffpasteboarddocumentID"] = currentDocID;  // May not exist as a key

NSData *updatedData = [NSPropertyListSerialization
    dataFromPropertyList:plist
    format:NSPropertyListBinaryFormat_v1_0
    errorDescription:NULL];
```

#### Step 3: Write Updated Data and Paste

```objc
NSPasteboard *pb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
[pb clearContents];

NSString *pasteboardUTI = @"com.apple.flexo.proFFPasteboardUTI";
[pb setData:updatedData forType:pasteboardUTI];

// Paste
[timelineModule performSelector:@selector(paste:) withObject:nil];
```

#### Advantages

- Preserves the exact native clipboard data with all attributes
- Works for complex effect stacks that FCPXML can't fully express

#### Limitations

- Two-step process — import may briefly flash media in the browser
- `documentID` patching is fragile; the internal `ffpasteboardobject` data (**NSKeyedArchiver**-encoded) contains embedded references that need the correct library context
- **Tested correction**: The `ffpasteboardobject` is opaque NSKeyedArchiver data (not FFCoder). The archive contains a full object graph with 265+ objects. Modifying individual attributes requires NSKeyedUnarchiver/NSKeyedArchiver round-tripping, which requires FCP's private classes to be registered.

---

### Solution 3: File URL + Programmatic Attribute Restore (Simplest Fallback) — PARTIALLY TESTED

The most pragmatic approach if you just need volume and a few properties.

> **Tested**: File URL paste enables FCP's paste command. The clip lands on the timeline.
> Attribute restoration via inspector was not verified (requires flexo bridge connection).

#### Step 1: Paste via File URL

```objc
// Write the file URL to the pasteboard
NSPasteboard *pb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
[pb clearContents];
[pb writeObjects:@[[NSURL fileURLWithPath:sfxFilePath]]];

// Paste — FCP imports and places the clip with default attributes
[timelineModule performSelector:@selector(paste:) withObject:nil];
```

#### Step 2: Select and Restore Attributes

After paste, the clip is on the timeline with default properties. Restore saved attributes:

```python
# Via SpliceKit JSON-RPC:

# Select the just-pasted clip
timeline_action("selectClipAtPlayhead")

# Restore volume
set_inspector_property("volume", -6.0)

# Restore other properties
set_inspector_property("opacity", 0.75)
set_inspector_property("positionX", 100.0)
set_inspector_property("positionY", 50.0)

# Restore effects (if you saved effect IDs)
# Apply via menu or effect browser
execute_menu_command(["Edit", "Paste Effects"])
```

#### Advantages

- Simple, well-understood, no pasteboard hacking
- Works reliably — URL paste always succeeds
- Each attribute restoration is individually verifiable

#### Limitations

- Multi-step — possible timing issues between paste and attribute application
- Can't easily restore complex effect stacks with custom parameters
- Relies on inspector property access for each attribute

---

### Solution 4: Intercept with `mediaByReferenceOnly:NO` (Advanced) — NOT TESTED

The `newEditsWithProject:mediaByReferenceOnly:options:` method on `FFPasteboard` has a boolean flag that controls media resolution behavior.

When `mediaByReferenceOnly` is YES, it sets `assetFlags` bit 14 (0x4000), meaning "only create references, expect media already linked." When NO (assetFlags = 0), and the pasteboard contains file URLs, FCP enters a different code path that uses `FFFileImporter` to actually import the media files.

#### How It Works

```objc
Class FFPasteboardClass = objc_getClass("FFPasteboard");
id ffpb = [[FFPasteboardClass alloc]
    performSelector:@selector(initWithPasteboard:)
         withObject:[NSPasteboard generalPasteboard]];

id project = /* current project */;

// Call with mediaByReferenceOnly:NO to trigger media import
id edits = [ffpb performSelector:@selector(newEditsWithProject:mediaByReferenceOnly:options:)
                      withObject:project
                      withObject:@NO     // force media import
                      withObject:nil];
```

#### When This Works

This path activates when the pasteboard has **file URLs** alongside other data. It:

1. Validates URLs via `FFFileImporter.validateURLs:withURLsInfo:forImportToLocation:...`
2. Imports via `FFFileImporter.importToEvent:manageFileType:processNow:...`
3. Returns imported clips as `FigTimeRangeAndObject` items

#### Limitations

- Only helps when file URLs are on the pasteboard — won't rescue pure native clipboard data with missing media
- The returned objects still need to be inserted into the timeline
- More complex to orchestrate than the FCPXML approach

### Appendix B: Public Pasteboard Types & Discovery

#### Known Public UTI Strings (Apple-Documented)

These are documented by Apple for workflow extensions and drag-and-drop integration:

| UTI String | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml` | Generic FCPXML — always supported |
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-8` | FCPXML 1.8 (FCP 10.4) |
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-9` | FCPXML 1.9 (FCP 10.4.1) |
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-10` | FCPXML 1.10 (FCP 10.5) |
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11` | FCPXML 1.11 (FCP 10.6) |
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-12` | FCPXML 1.12 |
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-13` | FCPXML 1.13 |
| `com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-14` | FCPXML 1.14 |

**Best practice** (per Apple docs): Support the generic type (current DTD at your release) and also version-specific types for current and previous DTD versions.

#### Runtime Discovery (Optional)

If you want to confirm what the running FCP version supports:

```objc
// From within FCP's process (e.g., via injected dylib or SpliceKit)
Class IXType = objc_getClass("IXXMLPasteboardType");

NSLog(@"=== IXXMLPasteboardType UTIs ===");
NSLog(@"current:          %@", [IXType current]);
NSLog(@"previous:         %@", [IXType previous]);
NSLog(@"previousPrevious: %@", [IXType previousPrevious]);
NSLog(@"generic:          %@", [IXType generic]);
NSLog(@"string:           %@", [IXType string]);
NSLog(@"all:              %@", [IXType all]);
```

#### Paste Priority Order

FCP's `FFXMLTranslationTask` checks pasteboard types in this order:
1. `IXXMLPasteboardType.current` (highest version)
2. `IXXMLPasteboardType.previous`
3. `IXXMLPasteboardType.previousPrevious`
4. `IXXMLPasteboardType.generic`
5. Falls back to `IXXMLPasteboardType.string` (reads as plain text, converts to data)

When writing, use both the generic type and the version-specific type matching your FCPXML version for maximum compatibility.

> **Tested findings**:
> - Generic UTI (`com.apple.finalcutpro.xml`) alone: **works** — paste enabled, clip imported
> - Versioned UTI alone (`com.apple.finalcutpro.xml.v1-11`): **does NOT work** — paste disabled
> - Both generic + versioned: **works** (recommended)
> - FCPXML as `public.utf8-plain-text`: **does NOT work** — paste disabled (despite step 5 suggesting string fallback, this only applies to the FCP XML-specific string type, not general plain text)
> - FCP does NOT write FCPXML types when copying clips — only `com.apple.flexo.proFFPasteboardUTI`

---

### Appendix C: Key Internal Classes

| Class | Methods | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| `FFPasteboard` | 76 | Clipboard read/write coordinator |
| `FFPasteboardItem` | ~20 | Serialized clipboard item (NSPasteboardWriting/Reading) |
| `FFPasteboardItemPromise` | ~15 | Lazy-loaded clipboard data (NSPasteboardItemDataProvider) |
| `FFXMLTranslationTask` | ~10 | Converts FCPXML pasteboard data for import |
| `FFXMLImportOptions` | ~15 | Configuration for XML import (incremental, conflict resolution) |
| `FFFileImporter` | ~20 | File-based media import |
| `IXXMLPasteboardType` | 18 | FCPXML pasteboard UTI type definitions |
| `FFCoder` | ~10 | Encodes/decodes FCP model objects to NSData (⚠️ clipboard uses NSKeyedArchiver instead) |

---

### Recommended Approach: FCPXML Import ✅ TESTED

The pasteboard import now calls `importWithOptions:` (the full-document import) first,
and on FCP 12.3 that path applies per-clip `adjust-volume` and `adjust-blend` itself: a
clip imported with `<adjust-volume amount="-8dB"/>` reads a gain of 0.398 (-8.00 dB)
straight after the import. `importClipsWithOptions:` (browser clips only) is the
fallback for XML without a project.

SpliceKit used to "restore" those attributes after the import: it parsed them from the
XML, ran `selectAll:` on whatever timeline was open and set the value through the
inspector on the selection. With another project open, that selected every clip in the
user's project and aimed the change at it, so the step was removed.

#### From SpliceKit — Single Call (tested, working):

```python
# fcpxml.pasteImport:
# 1. Imports the XML via FFXMLTranslationTask (media linking)
# 2. FCP applies adjust-volume / adjust-blend from the XML itself
#
# Returns: {"status": "ok", "importOK": true, "library": "...", "libraryChosenBy": "..."}

fcpxml.pasteImport(xml='''<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE fcpxml>
<fcpxml version="1.14">

#### How the Bridge Does It (implementation detail)

The `SpliceKit_handlePasteboardImportXML` function in `Sources/Bridge/SpliceKitServerFCPXML.m`:

1. **Writes FCPXML to the system pasteboard** using `IXXMLPasteboardType.generic` and `.current` UTIs
2. **Creates `FFXMLTranslationTask`** from the pasteboard via `initForPasteboard:`
3. **Configures `FFXMLImportOptions`** with:
   - `setIncrementalImport:YES` — merge into existing library
   - `setConflictResolutionType:3` — merge, don't replace
   - `setLibrary:` — targets the library named by `library=`, else the one the XML's
     `<library location>` names when open, else the first open library (prevents "Which library?" dialog)
   - `setTargetEvent:` — targets the current timeline's event
4. **Calls `importWithOptions:`** (full document), falling back to
   `importClipsWithOptions:` for clip-only XML — imports media, creates the project;
   FCP applies `adjust-volume` / `adjust-blend` itself
5. **Returns** `{"status":"ok", "importOK": true, "library": "...", "libraryChosenBy": "..."}`

#### Building a Workflow Extension That Uses This

A workflow extension (`.appex`) runs out-of-process but can communicate with SpliceKit
over TCP. Here's a complete implementation:

##### 1. Extension View Controller (SwiftUI)

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ProExtension

struct SFXItem: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let filePath: String
    let volumeDB: Double      // e.g., -8.0
    let opacity: Double?       // e.g., 0.75 (nil = don't change)
}

class SFXViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [SFXItem] = []
    
    func addToTimeline(_ item: SFXItem) {
        // Build FCPXML with attributes embedded
        let fcpxml = buildFCPXML(item: item)
        
        // Send to SpliceKit — it handles import + attribute restoration
        SpliceKitClient.shared.pasteImport(xml: fcpxml) { result in
            print("Import result: \(result)")
        }
    }
    
    func buildFCPXML(item: SFXItem) -> String {
        let src = URL(fileURLWithPath: item.filePath).absoluteString
        let projName = "SFX_\(item.name)_\(Int.random(in: 1000...9999))"
        
        var adjustments = ""
        adjustments += "\n              <adjust-volume amount=\"\(item.volumeDB)dB\"/>"
        if let opa = item.opacity {
            // Only include adjust-blend for video clips
            adjustments += "\n              <adjust-blend amount=\"\(opa)\" mode=\"0\"/>"
        }
        
        return """
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE fcpxml>
        <fcpxml version="1.14">
          <resources>
            <format id="r0" frameDuration="100/2400s" width="1920" height="1080"/>
            <asset id="r1" hasAudio="1" hasVideo="0"
                   audioSources="1" audioChannels="2" audioRate="48000">
              <media-rep kind="original-media" src="\(src)"/>
            </asset>
          </resources>
          <library>
            <event name="SFX Import">
              <project name="\(projName)">
                <sequence format="r0" duration="2400/2400s">
                  <spine>
                    <asset-clip ref="r1" name="\(item.name)" duration="2400/2400s"
                                start="0s" format="r0">\(adjustments)
                    </asset-clip>
                  </spine>
                </sequence>
              </project>
            </event>
          </library>
        </fcpxml>
        """
    }
}
```

##### 2. SpliceKit TCP Client (for use inside the extension)

```swift
import Foundation

class SpliceKitClient {
    static let shared = SpliceKitClient()
    
    private let host = "127.0.0.1"
    private let port: UInt16 = 9876
    private var requestID = 0
    
    /// Import FCPXML with automatic attribute restoration.
    /// The bridge parses adjust-volume/adjust-blend from the XML,
    /// imports the clip, then applies the attributes via inspector.
    func pasteImport(xml: String, completion: @escaping ([String: Any]) -> Void) {
        call(method: "fcpxml.pasteImport", params: ["xml": xml], completion: completion)
    }
    
    /// Set a single inspector property on the selected clip.
    func setInspectorProperty(_ property: String, value: Any,
                              completion: @escaping ([String: Any]) -> Void) {
        call(method: "inspector.set",
             params: ["property": property, "value": value],
             completion: completion)
    }
    
    /// Execute a timeline action (selectAll, paste, blade, etc.)
    func timelineAction(_ action: String, completion: @escaping ([String: Any]) -> Void) {
        call(method: "timeline.action", params: ["action": action], completion: completion)
    }
    
    // MARK: - JSON-RPC Transport
    
    private func call(method: String, params: [String: Any],
                      completion: @escaping ([String: Any]) -> Void) {
        DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async { [self] in
            requestID += 1
            let request: [String: Any] = [
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "method": method,
                "params": params,
                "id": requestID
            ]
            
            guard let data = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: request),
                  var message = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else {
                completion(["error": "Failed to serialize request"])
                return
            }
            message += "\n"
            
            let sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
            guard sock >= 0 else {
                completion(["error": "Failed to create socket"])
                return
            }
            defer { close(sock) }
            
            var addr = sockaddr_in()
            addr.sin_family = sa_family_t(AF_INET)
            addr.sin_port = port.bigEndian
            addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(host)
            
            let connectResult = withUnsafePointer(to: &addr) {
                $0.withMemoryRebound(to: sockaddr.self, capacity: 1) {
                    connect(sock, $0, socklen_t(MemoryLayout<sockaddr_in>.size))
                }
            }
            guard connectResult == 0 else {
                completion(["error": "Cannot connect to SpliceKit"])
                return
            }
            
            // Set 30s timeout
            var tv = timeval(tv_sec: 30, tv_usec: 0)
            setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &tv, socklen_t(MemoryLayout<timeval>.size))
            
            // Send
            message.withCString { ptr in
                _ = send(sock, ptr, strlen(ptr), 0)
            }
            
            // Receive until newline
            var buffer = Data()
            var byte = UInt8(0)
            while recv(sock, &byte, 1, 0) == 1 {
                if byte == 0x0A { break }  // newline
                buffer.append(byte)
            }
            
            guard let response = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: buffer) as? [String: Any] else {
                completion(["error": "Invalid response"])
                return
            }
            
            if let error = response["error"] {
                completion(["error": error])
            } else {
                completion(response["result"] as? [String: Any] ?? [:])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### 3. Drag-and-Drop Alternative (for timeline insertion)

If you prefer drag-and-drop over the `fcpxml.pasteImport` API call, provide FCPXML
via `NSPasteboardItemDataProvider` and restore attributes after the drop:

```swift
class SFXDragProvider: NSObject, NSPasteboardItemDataProvider {
    let item: SFXItem
    
    init(item: SFXItem) { self.item = item }
    
    func pasteboard(_ pasteboard: NSPasteboard,
                    item pbItem: NSPasteboardItem,
                    provideDataForType type: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType) {
        let fcpxml = SFXViewModel().buildFCPXML(item: self.item)
        if let data = fcpxml.data(using: .utf8) {
            pbItem.setData(data, forType: type)
        }
    }
    
    // After drop completes, restore attributes
    func restoreAttributes() {
        // Small delay to let FCP process the drop
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.0) {
            SpliceKitClient.shared.timelineAction("selectClipAtPlayhead") { _ in
                SpliceKitClient.shared.setInspectorProperty("volume", value: self.item.volumeDB) { _ in
                    if let opa = self.item.opacity {
                        SpliceKitClient.shared.setInspectorProperty("opacity", value: opa) { _ in }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Start drag:
let provider = SFXDragProvider(item: sfxItem)
let pbItem = NSPasteboardItem()
pbItem.setDataProvider(provider,
    forTypes: [.init("com.apple.finalcutpro.xml")])
// ... start drag session with pbItem
// Call provider.restoreAttributes() when drag completes
```

#### Important Notes

- **Audio-only clips** must NOT include `<adjust-blend>` (opacity) — this causes import failure
- **Video clips** can include both `<adjust-volume>` and `<adjust-blend>`
- The bridge's `fcpxml.pasteImport` creates a **new project** per import, not a clip in the
  current timeline. The project name is taken from `<project name=...>` in the FCPXML.
- Use unique project names to avoid conflicts (add a random suffix)
- `adjust-volume amount` uses dB format (e.g., `"-8dB"`)
- The `inspector.set` value for volume uses the dB scale directly (e.g., `-8.0`)

---

### Appendix D: Workflow Extension Timeline API

If you're building a workflow extension (`.appex`), you have official API access to the FCP timeline. This is relevant for Solution 3 (programmatic attribute restoration) and for monitoring when clips are pasted.

#### Timeline Access Pattern

```swift
import ProExtension

// 1. Get host singleton
guard let host = ProExtensionHostSingleton() as? FCPXHost else { return }

// 2. Access timeline
guard let timeline = host.timeline else { return }

// 3. Register for changes
timeline.add(self) // self conforms to FCPXTimelineObserver

// 4. Read current state
let sequence = timeline.activeSequence       // FCPXSequence?
let playhead = timeline.playheadTime()       // CMTime
let range = timeline.sequenceTimeRange       // CMTimeRange

// 5. Move playhead
let newPos = timeline.movePlayhead(to: targetTime)  // returns confirmed CMTime
```

#### Observer Callbacks

```swift
extension MyViewController: FCPXTimelineObserver {
    func activeSequenceChanged() {
        // New sequence loaded — refresh UI
        let seq = host.timeline?.activeSequence
        print("Sequence: \(seq?.name), duration: \(seq?.duration)")
    }
    
    func playheadTimeChanged() {
        // Playhead moved (click, drag, or playback stop — NOT during playback)
        let time = host.timeline?.playheadTime()
    }
    
    func sequenceTimeRangeChanged() {
        // Timeline bounds changed
        let range = host.timeline?.sequenceTimeRange
    }
}
```

#### Navigating the Container Hierarchy

```swift
let sequence = timeline.activeSequence          // FCPXSequence
let project = sequence?.container as? FCPXProject  // FCPXProject
let event = project?.container as? FCPXEvent       // FCPXEvent (uid, name)
let library = event?.container as? FCPXLibrary     // FCPXLibrary (url, name)
```

#### Security-Scoped Bookmarks

If your extension needs to access media files on disk, you need security-scoped bookmark entitlements:

```xml
<!-- In your .entitlements file -->
<key>com.apple.security.files.bookmarks.app-scope</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.files.bookmarks.document-scope</key>
<true/>
```

When receiving bookmark data (e.g., from FCPXML drag-out from FCP):
1. Decode Base64-encoded bookmark data
2. Resolve to security-scoped URL with `NSURLBookmarkResolutionWithSecurityScope`
3. Call `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` before file access
4. Call `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` when done

#### Key Limitations

- Workflow extensions run **out-of-process** — no direct access to FCP's internal classes
- The `FCPXTimeline` API is read-only for sequence/playhead; you can move the playhead but can't directly modify clips
- To modify the timeline, you must go through FCPXML (paste/import) or Apple Events
- FCP terminates extensions when the floating window closes — save state to persistent storage

---

### Appendix E: Debugging Pasteboard Contents

To inspect what's currently on the pasteboard:

```objc
NSPasteboard *pb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
NSLog(@"Types on pasteboard: %@", [pb types]);

for (NSString *type in [pb types]) {
    NSData *data = [pb dataForType:type];
    NSLog(@"Type: %@ — %lu bytes", type, (unsigned long)data.length);
    
    // Try to decode as plist (works for FFPasteboardItem data)
    id plist = [NSPropertyListSerialization
        propertyListWithData:data
        options:0 format:NULL error:NULL];
    if (plist) {
        NSLog(@"  Plist: %@", plist);
    }
    
    // Try to decode as string (works for FCPXML string type)
    NSString *str = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    if (str && str.length < 2000) {
        NSLog(@"  String: %@", str);
    }
}
```

This is especially useful for capturing what FCP writes to the pasteboard when you copy a clip — you can see the exact structure of `ffpasteboardobject`, `ffpasteboardcopiedtypes`, etc.

> **Tested**: When you copy a clip from FCP's timeline, only one type appears:
> `com.apple.flexo.proFFPasteboardUTI` (15,438 bytes for a single video clip). No FCPXML types.
> The plist has 3 keys: `ffpasteboardobject` (NSKeyedArchiver, 15,263 bytes),
> `ffpasteboardcopiedtypes`, `kffmodelobjectIDs` (empty array).

#### Decoding NSKeyedArchiver Clipboard Data (Tested)

To decode the inner `ffpasteboardobject` data, decode it as a second binary plist:

```objc
NSData *objData = plist[@"ffpasteboardobject"];
// It's NSKeyedArchiver format — decode as plist to inspect
NSDictionary *archive = [NSPropertyListSerialization
    propertyListWithData:objData options:0 format:NULL error:NULL];
NSArray *objects = archive[@"$objects"];  // Array of 265+ encoded objects
// objects contains: strings (UUIDs, names, paths), class dictionaries,
// NSData blobs, numbers, etc.

// Find class names:
for (id obj in objects) {
    if ([obj isKindOfClass:[NSDictionary class]] && obj[@"$classname"]) {
        NSLog(@"Class: %@", obj[@"$classname"]);
    }
}
// Classes found: FFAnchoredMediaComponent, FFAnchoredCollection, FFAsset,
// FFAssetRef, FFEffectStack, FFHeColorEffect, FFHeConformEffect,
// FFIntrinsicColorConformEffect, FFMediaRep, FFMediaResource,
// FFMediaResourceMap, FFAudioClipComponentsLayoutMap, FFObjectDict
```

### Appendix F: Test Methodology (historical)

The AppleScript and Cmd+V / Cmd+Z steps below are how these 2026 experiments were run;
the project now forbids AppleScript and synthetic keystrokes, so do not reuse them.

Tests were conducted April 2026 against FCP 11.1 on macOS Sequoia 15.4 using:

1. **Swift CLI tool** for NSPasteboard manipulation (write FCPXML/URLs, read back native data)
2. **AppleScript** (via `NSAppleScript`) for FCP interaction (activate, Cmd+V paste, Cmd+Z undo, menu inspection)
3. **MCP bridge tools** for FCP state queries (library/event/project listing) when bridge was connected

#### Test procedure for each pasteboard variant:
1. Write data to `NSPasteboard.general` with specific UTI types
2. Activate FCP via AppleScript
3. Send Cmd+V keystroke
4. Wait 2.5 seconds for import processing
5. Read Edit menu's Undo/Redo item names to confirm paste action
6. Send Cmd+Z to undo and restore timeline state

#### Confirmed test environment:
- Library: "Untitled" with events "4-3-26", "Montage"
- Active project: "Here We Go Montage" (29.75s, 24fps, 1920x1080)
- Test media: `/System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff` (0.77s audio-only)
