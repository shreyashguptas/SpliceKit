## Overview

SpliceKit provides two analysis tools that detect structural boundaries in
media — scene changes in video and beats in audio. These can be used
independently or together to automate editing decisions:

| Tool | Input | Detects | Use Case |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `detect_scene_changes()` | Timeline video | Cuts, transitions, shot boundaries | Auto-blade at scene changes |
| `detect_beats()` | Audio file | Beats, bars, sections, BPM | Cut video to music rhythm |

---

## Scene Change Detection

Analyzes the current timeline's video to detect cuts and shot boundaries using
histogram comparison (the same approach FCP uses internally).

### Basic Detection

```python
# Detect scene changes with default settings
detect_scene_changes()
```

Returns a list of timestamps where scene changes were detected, with confidence
scores for each:

```
Scene changes: 12 (threshold=0.35, file=interview.mov)

  2.30s  (score: 0.892)
  5.10s  (score: 0.756)
  8.45s  (score: 0.934)
  12.80s (score: 0.671)
  ...
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `threshold` | 0.35 | Sensitivity (0.0–1.0). Lower = more sensitive, detects subtle changes. Higher = only strong cuts. |
| `action` | `"detect"` | What to do: `"detect"` (list only), `"markers"` (add markers at cuts), `"blade"` (blade at cuts) |
| `sample_interval` | 0.1 | Seconds between sampled frames. Lower = more accurate but slower. |

### Adjusting Sensitivity

```python
# Very sensitive — detect even subtle changes (pans, lighting shifts)
detect_scene_changes(threshold=0.15)

# Less sensitive — only detect hard cuts
detect_scene_changes(threshold=0.6)

# Faster analysis with larger sample interval
detect_scene_changes(threshold=0.35, sample_interval=0.25)
```

### Auto-Blade at Scene Changes

```python
# Automatically blade the timeline at every detected scene change
detect_scene_changes(action="blade")
```

This performs a blade operation at each detected timestamp, splitting the
timeline into individual shots.

### Mark Scene Changes

```python
# Add markers at scene changes (non-destructive)
detect_scene_changes(action="markers")
```

Adds standard markers at each detected cut point for review before making
any edits.

### Workflow: Auto-Segment Long Footage

```python
# 1. Detect scene changes and add markers for review
detect_scene_changes(action="markers", threshold=0.3)

# 2. Review the markers, then blade if they look right
detect_scene_changes(action="blade", threshold=0.3)

# 3. Now each shot is a separate clip — rate, rearrange, or delete
```

---

## Beat Detection

Analyzes any audio file to detect beats, bars, sections, and BPM using onset
detection and tempo estimation. Runs as an external process to avoid
AVFoundation deadlocks inside FCP.

### Basic Detection

```python
# Detect beats in an audio file
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/music.mp3")
```

Returns beat timestamps, bar timestamps (every 4 beats), section timestamps
(every 16 beats), detected BPM, and total duration.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `file_path` | (required) | Path to audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, AIFF) |
| `sensitivity` | 0.5 | Detection sensitivity (0.0–1.0). Higher = more beats detected. |
| `min_bpm` | 60.0 | Minimum expected BPM |
| `max_bpm` | 200.0 | Maximum expected BPM |

### Adjusting Detection

```python
# More sensitive — detect subtle rhythmic elements
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/song.mp3", sensitivity=0.8)

# Less sensitive — only strong beats
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/song.mp3", sensitivity=0.3)

# For fast electronic music
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/edm.mp3", min_bpm=120, max_bpm=180)

# For slow ballads
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/ballad.mp3", min_bpm=50, max_bpm=100)
```

### Building the Beat Detector

The beat detector is a standalone Swift tool that must be built first:

```bash
cd SpliceKit
swiftc -O -o build/beat-detector helpers/beat-detector.swift
```

The tool is searched in these locations:
1. `SpliceKit/build/beat-detector`
2. `/usr/local/bin/beat-detector`
3. `~/Documents/GitHub/SpliceKit/build/beat-detector`

### Beat Data for Montage

Beat detection output can be fed directly into the montage system:

```python
# 1. Detect beats in a song
beats = detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/music.mp3")

# 2. Use the beat timestamps to plan a montage
montage_plan_edit(
    clips_json=clips,
    beat_timestamps=beats,
    cut_style="on_beat"
)

# 3. Assemble the montage on the timeline
montage_assemble(plan_json=plan)
```

---

## Combined Workflows

### Music Video: Cut to Beat

```python
# 1. Detect beats in the music track
beats = detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/song.mp3")

# 2. Import the music to the timeline
# (via FCPXML or manually)

# 3. Detect scene changes in the raw footage
scenes = detect_scene_changes(threshold=0.3)

# 4. Use the montage system to auto-assemble clips to beats
montage_auto(song_path="/path/to/song.mp3")
```

### Auto-Segment Interview + Add Music Markers

```python
# 1. Blade at scene changes (camera angle switches)
detect_scene_changes(action="blade", threshold=0.25)

# 2. Detect beats in background music for pacing reference
detect_beats(file_path="/path/to/background-music.mp3")

# 3. Use beat timestamps to place markers for rhythm-aware editing
```

### Rough Cut Automation

```python
# 1. Start with long uncut footage on timeline
# 2. Detect all scene changes
detect_scene_changes(action="blade")

# 3. Now each shot is a separate clip
# 4. Use timeline_action to rate/organize the clips
playback_action("goToStart")
timeline_action("selectClipAtPlayhead")
timeline_action("favorite")  # mark good takes
playback_action("nextFrame", repeat=120)
timeline_action("selectClipAtPlayhead")
timeline_action("reject")    # mark bad takes
```

---

## Additional Analysis Tools

### Playhead Position

Get precise playhead position for analysis-driven workflows:

```python
get_playhead_position()
# Returns: seconds, duration, frameRate, isPlaying
```

### Timeline Analysis

Analyze timeline structure and health:

```python
analyze_timeline()
# Returns: clip count, duration, pacing stats, potential issues
# (flash frames, long clips, short clips)
```

### SRT Import as Markers

Import subtitle timestamps as timeline markers:

```python
import_srt_as_markers(srt_content="""
1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First subtitle

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Second subtitle
""")
```

Each subtitle becomes a marker at the corresponding timecode, useful for
marking sections referenced in scripts or transcripts.

*Scene detection uses GPU-accelerated histogram comparison. Beat detection
runs as an external process using AVFoundation's audio analysis. Both operate
on-device with no network dependency.*
